        <title>Donald Trump has made me proud to be an American again</title>
        <author>David Hepworth</author>
        <description>
            &lt;p&gt;I honestly did not believe it to be possible, after years of disappointment, frustration, and diminishing esteem for the country, to actually be able to consider the possibility of hope and pride for the future of the United States. I think I owe gratitude to Donald Trump for this, though I don’t think he would be pleased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to have an overwhelmingly positive view of the country. The sources to which I was exposed in my childhood were only too eager to teach a romanticized view of the country. Outside of any recent politicians who were not registered Republicans, speaking ill of any of the leaders of the country, especially the founders, was unacceptable. Past despicable actions of the country were sanitized to obscure wrongdoing, often shifting blame to the victims. Because of this dogmatic view of the history of the United States, my deconstruction of this view caused much pain and anger in me. In waking to the criminal behavior endemic in the country, I began to lose hope or pride in its existence. Cynicism and nihilism grew in me as I saw wrongdoing after wrongdoing presented plainly by less-biased history books, documentaries, and historians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are moments in history where I can recall stumbling from the path presented to me by my Republican heritage. I believed that my views were based on justice, fairness, and love, but those who claimed to represent me and espouse those views kept doing things that seemed hateful, cruel, and criminal — and worse, they kept getting away with it. Meanwhile, the people who opposed my views kept talking about love, were behaving with more empathy, and kept holding each other accountable to a high standard. With each successive exposure to these contrary views, I felt increasingly fraudulent when I claimed the moral superiority of my views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Bush was the first President for whom I could vote, and I earnestly did twice, believing he was being honest when he said a long-term occupation was noble and necessary to prevent terrorist activities from ever happening again on U.S. soil. I didn’t believe the accusations of torture of Iraqi detainees because President Bush said both that no such torture was happening and that it could never be categorized as torture because the U.S. doesn’t torture people. I thought the installing of the TSA in airports was an acceptable discomfort because it kept us safe, even if I couldn’t exactly pinpoint how. When the &lt;em&gt;Occupy Wall Street&lt;/em&gt; movement occurred, I sided with the billionaires, because I believed that Republicans were just and fair and would obviously tax oligarchs the proper amount they owed. When the DMCA was signed into law, I sided with the companies because I believed they were only seeking fair compensation for the artists and would never exploit the law to harm their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each time I defended these events I felt a little dirty, a little ashamed to hear myself speak. Why did saying something right and good make me feel so weird and bad?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Obama’s election was so different from President Bush’s. People were happy, but not happy like I’d seen when Bush got two terms. There wasn’t the same level of vindictiveness or a lusting for vengeance that I felt when Bush was put into office. People seemed to just be glad and hopeful that things could get better for them — not through long-term mazes of events that could one day conclude in making their life better like the trickle-down economics policies of the Republican platform, but through laws and actions that would directly affect their daily lives. What people were asking of President Obama wasn’t to punish people for living differently than themselves but just for same level of rights others already enjoyed. The things voters asked of President Obama were things that directly matched what I saw as good and just, but I found myself having to be opposed to them because he was a Democrat and I as a Republican was duty-bound to oppose him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For eight years I had to ignore the cognitive dissonance, holding fast to President Obama’s bad decisions and purposefully ignoring his most fondly-regarded choices. I saw the birther claims Trump made as credible and worried that President Obama was perhaps a secret Muslim, trying to overthrow the government and Christianity. I believed his Affordable Care Act was going to be a tragedy because private healthcare was obviously always a superior choice; Republicans told me so. Throughout all this I had to restrict all the thoughts of how empathy, love, caring for others, thinking of the poor first, contributing what you have to help others in need, sharing and pooling resources freely — ideals that the Democrats kept talking about and the Republicans kept vilifying — were precisely the sorts of ideals recorded in the Bible being attributed to Jesus, the deity of Christianity, the belief system the Republicans claimed as their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump changed everything for me. He was already awful before he was elected, but his time as President was filled with many more egregious flaws that threatened the stability of the country and the safety of its citizens: bungling the management of the Black Lives Matter protests, fomenting panic in the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns, encouraging injustice and dismantling of hard-fought rights through his choices for Supreme Court judges, embarrassing the country in front of its allies as well as its adversaries, and eventually attempting a coup to overthrow the U.S. government to put himself in place as permanent dictator. Each one of these should have lost him all favor among his constituents, those who cried out for truth and justice and morality, but instead his supporters rallied around him more. The flag, already tarnished through my years of learning of the country’s history, now became stained by the bigoted and racist Republicans who seemed to be growing in number, reputation, and strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began to feel deep shame in being an American. I could only see the terror the country caused, both to those outside its borders and to those born and living within. The level of inhumanity Trump’s cabinet and his supporters across state governments was reaching levels I thought impossible from a good and decent country, which led me to conclude that the United States was neither good nor decent. The flag became a symbol of hatred, racism, and bigotry, and those who chose to bear its image gave me unease because I saw it as a tacit approval of the worst behaviors of the President. I fantasized about fleeing the country and then grew despondent when I worried that nobody would want to accept me, stained as I was by my U.S. citizenship. How could any other country know if I could be trusted when I wasn’t certain how much I could trust my own neighbors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I appreciated the surprising number of progressive actions President Biden took during his time in office, I had serious doubts that he was going to be re-elected. I grew even more despondent after watching the disastrous debate where his cognitive decline became extremely apparent. A numbness had creeped into my mind, a coping tool to prevent me from falling into a chasm of anxiety. Would the United States be able to survive another Trump term? Would anyone be able to save us from ourselves, and what level of misery would that salvation bring?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then President Biden chose to not seek re-election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fears had been that from all the news media’s normalization of Trump’s terrible behavior, as well as many of my neighbors in Oklahoma brazenly displaying their support of Trump, that there were nearly no decent people left in the United States, and that I was watching the country fall to fascism, Christian nationalism, and deeply back into its history of racism and persecution of minorities; but now I think I’m incredibly incorrect in my assumptions. People seem to be coming alive across the country to do whatever they can to not have Trump return and to prevent regressive policies from encroaching further in our lives, even perhaps pushing back hard against the ones that returned. It’s frustrating that it took us all losing ground in progress across so many areas of our lives to finally wake up and start fighting back again, but I am so happy to see the action to fight back against this tyranny. The outpouring of support to prevent Donald Trump from further damaging this country has stirred national pride in me that has not been there for nearly a decade. I feel hope. I feel there is a chance things might turn out okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not fully satisfied with Harris and Walz: they aren’t outspoken about the genocide in Palestine, climate change is largely forgotten in their messaging, and they’re way too happy to talk about the oil, gas, and war machines ruining our future. The difference for me is that I honestly wasn’t sure if there was any chance any of those could even be considered at some point in the future, never mind all the other very important things that Harris and Walz have addressed. Electing these two offers chances for progress that were essentially non-existent before, including the tough issues they’ve been hesitant to discuss during this the election campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kamala Harris stepped up and made a fool out of Donald Trump in their debate. I think she can get elected. I think she might be able to do even more for the country than what President Biden managed. I think things might turn out better than I expected. I have many hopes and worries about the future, but I know one thing for certain: she has my vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Donald.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What grief has done to us</title>
        <author>David Hepworth</author>
        <description>
            &lt;p&gt;I think grief may highlight the oddities of humanity more than any other emotion available. Humans are irrational creatures on most occasions, but grief accentuates our strange thought processes. We experience grief in our weakest moments, when we are vulnerable and shaken, and we seem to seek relief from areas even most speculative, even more so than those sought in the midst of pain. I worry that perhaps sometimes we choose less useful avenues of escape over accepting the painful depths of our grief. I think back on my own brushes with grief and find such evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandfather in Michigan was seen by many in the family as a patriarch of a noble lineage that we all were duty-bound to maintain in the younger generations. There was attributed to him a particular level of honor and wisdom that separated him from most others even his own age, which made his eventual decline from Alzheimer’s all the more difficult to witness. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/30135275/franklin_bramwell-hepworth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Upon his death&lt;/a&gt; the family at large not only saw the loss of a father, grandfather, or great-grandfather, but also the departure of a rarified individual whose knowledge and experience may not be matched in our lifetimes. His history seemed to almost become legendary even before his death: I felt that our efforts to record his memories were rooted in his life stories achieving a sort of mythical status over the more personal process of wanting to remember him as accurately as we could manage. Years later, I still can’t be certain in my own thoughts whether I can consider him a mere man, despite it potentially making those memories sweeter. I wonder if perhaps he will forever be something more in my memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I really serving his memory well by seeing him as something more than a husband and father? I wonder if he would have wanted to be a heroic figure in the minds of his family, or if instead would he have wanted something more humble attributed to him. I think losing him in what seems now to be such an early part of my own life impacted the way I perceived my own life for many years afterward. I had deep anxieties about living up to the myth built around his life and the seemingly meagre existence I had eked out by that time. My own death began to grow in significance in my mind, for not only did I see it as the point at which I would once again see my grandfather, but it would also mark the time where my ability to make change for the sake of the family line would end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why didn’t I just mourn the loss of someone important? Why did it get mixed up in something so much bigger? It took longer for me to say goodbye by getting it all tangled up in history I never witnessed. The man I knew was one who enjoyed gardening, growing flowers and vegetables for the neighborhood farmer’s market, who liked to chat it up at the dining room table, who liked playing with his young grandchildren and sharing the toys he purchased on his trips to Florida in the winter. That was my grandfather, but I didn’t feel comfortable just saying goodbye to that version of him: I felt that I had to add more to honor his memory, and it distorted my grief. It took time for me to let parts of him fall away to mourn what remained in my mind — someone who appeared far more human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.christianpost.com/news/voice-of-the-marytrs-tom-whites-suicide-confirmed-molestation-case-closed.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;old employer committed suicide&lt;/a&gt; for his alleged abuse of a child, I advocated for his probable innocence instead of accepting that I may have been a friend to someone capable of such actions. I claimed that we should honor his memory by not omitting his name from our conversation, or that perhaps the allegations were far less serious than anyone thought, or that perhaps this was all a misunderstanding and we were too quick to condemn a potentially innocent man. It took me years to accept I could and was most likely wrong to defend the man. My grief was not only related to his actions, but for my own lack of insight into the mind of that man. I felt ashamed that my proximity to the man offered no warning clues for me to act on before he chose to not only harm a child but also himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt shame in feeling joy in remembering our conversations. His kindness to me felt wrong to accept posthumously. I felt dirty being associated with his memory, but it also felt like a betrayal to forget the impact he played in my life. He gave me furniture to furnish my small apartment. He helped pay for a flight and expedite my passport approval so that I could visit a friend in South Korea. He tutored me in my first real corporate job in my career, guiding me through the process of preparing a magazine each month. He was a friend, but he was also probably not as great a man as I built him in my mind to be, and that time around his death still hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t allow myself to simply be sad that a friend died. My grief had heightened my anxiety, made my shock at learning what had happened turn to shame and embarrassment, and transformed my fondness for the man into defensiveness, railing against the differing opinions of others as if they were targeting me instead of the deceased. It took years for me to be able to just be sad that I lost a friend who had made terrible choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pain triggers such basic parts of our brain that our rational mind can be stripped away. When the pain lesses, it offers us the chance to reconsider our actions and question our choices, providing a moment for us to build defenses for similar moments in the future. Preventing pain can be useful in places such as fire drills, but sometimes I think it can hinder our growth. When I look back at the painful moments of my life, I wonder if some of the methods I used to ease my pain in the moment ended up delaying my healing. I wonder if in my search for relief, I chose to pursue some options that might not be as reasonable as their alternatives. I was scrambling to find something to give me a reason to not have to grieve and feel the depth of my sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my grandfather died, I searched for a reason for why his death was prolonged, with his memory fading, his abilities diminishing, until he died in a comatose state, unable to wake from the fall he experienced in his final days. I tried to find meaning in his death, or evidence of his death being a catalyst for something better to come, but everything just came back to him dying and no longer being present. When my employer died, I bargained with the evidence and tried to convince myself that he was not the guilty man people claimed and that his suicide was more noble than cowardly, but no amount of campaigning for his legacy helped me see him back in the office again; he was still dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Death is the constant across all borders, cultures, and beliefs. But what I’ve noticed throughout my experiences with funerals is that people shy away from the death and focus on platitudes, seeking to escape the pain of grief. I think that this might be a mistake. Fully feeling the grief might be a wiser choice, along with the acceptance that no matter what one believes, everyone experiences the same reality that the person no longer is present &lt;em&gt;here,&lt;/em&gt; where the survivors remain. Some people believe in an afterlife, or reincarnation, or just the end of existence after death, but the &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt; of death is that the person one loves is gone now and the reality of that hurts deeply. I have only been able to heal by grappling with the things that I &lt;strong&gt;know&lt;/strong&gt; about death. I think that we delay our healing and add more anxiety to our life by diminishing the importance of what we know in favor of the things that we hope to be true. I think that we run from grief like we run from pain, attempting to hide or ignore it until it disappears. But it doesn’t disappear, it metastasizes and expands into something more permanent and disabling, and it takes a lot more pain to seek it out and remove it, and we might never recover from the damage it caused along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look back on my experiences with grief and I believe I handled each moment poorly. I should have been more ready to sit down and actually mourn for those who I lost, instead of bottling it, pretending it doesn’t hurt, seeking to explain it away, or even denying that it actually mattered that much. Every death of a loved one does matter, and not because of anything other than because that loved one died. I don’t need to have any greater reason than that to mourn, and I need not find any deeper meaning to the loss other than they are now absent from my life and I don’t like that. Weaving beliefs, myths, legends, noble causes, deep meanings, or any other potential inaccuracies into the life and death of an individual to explain their existence and then non-existence on Earth is to deny the beauty of them simply &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; here with me for a time. The people I love matter not because they did something, made certain choices, said certain things, or did whatever was necessary to satisfy the acceptance of others. People just matter, and those whom I love matter most to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of accepting a death doesn’t have to be more complicated that that, but grief keeps getting in the way and causing distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this 2015 lecture James Tabor talks about the ways in which dualistic forms of thinking about the cosmos, often referred to as “Enochian” in their Jewish forms and “Gnostic” in the wider Hellenistic world, basically took over the Western world and fundamentally transformed Judaism, Christianity, and Islam into religions of “cosmic salvation,” rather than ethical transformation of this world—what Judaism calls &lt;em&gt;Tikun Ha-&apos;Olam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change to focus on the afterlife to the detriment of the present existence reminds me of a passage from the Bible, where it details &lt;a href=&apos;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A31-46&amp;version=RSV&apos; target=&apos;_blank&apos;&gt;the ethical issues of ignoring the poor and needy&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to seek out the supernatural or the prospect of an afterlife.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The King James Version of the Bible, published in 1611, is the ALL TIME best selling book in English for the past several hundred years. Millions read it today and rely upon it as their ONLY Bible—in fact one often hears of fundamentalist and evangelical Churches that label themselves as “King James Only.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this short video I cover one of the most often overlooked factors for folks who read and love the King James.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A desire to find peace amidst grief may lead some to pursue calming inaccuracies, including clutching to dogma and doctrine that scholars may have long disproved.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learning new things about our universe</title>
        <author>David Hepworth</author>
        <description>
            &lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed watching the moody first season&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/originals/constellation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Constellation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the terrifically weird &lt;a href=&quot;https://a24films.com/films/everything-everywhere-all-at-once&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything Everywhere All at Once&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This is a surprise for me, because the inclusion of multiple universes in movies and television tended to exhaust me in the past. I thought having multiples of every person made the characters feel truly fictional. Knowing that at any moment someone from a marginally different universe could replace a character felt almost like a moral wrong. The possibility of multiple universes in a story felt like it cheapened the difficulties any character faced because a potentially infinite number of that character faced nearly the exact same problem. In one show, &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Voyager,&lt;/em&gt; two characters were &lt;a href=&quot;https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Deadlock_(episode)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;replaced in an episode&lt;/a&gt; and barely anything was mentioned about it afterward. Even the &lt;a href=&quot;https://screenrant.com/star-trek-voyager-original-harry-kim-duplicate/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;actor was conflicted&lt;/a&gt; about the storyline, and it remained a nagging plot point throughout the rest of the time I watched that show. &lt;em&gt;The character I’m watching may not be the one I knew.&lt;/em&gt; That’s horrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if it’s due to my age or maybe I’ve run out of shows to watch and I’ve become desperate, but I was surprised by how readily I accepted the premises of &lt;em&gt;Constellation&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Everything Everywhere All at Once.&lt;/em&gt; Maybe they’re being written better these days.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I was not expecting to find the multi-universe element to be so fascinating to me. I found myself feeling an urge to learn more about the science they claimed to be following, which was far different from the disdain I treated multi-universe storylines in the past. So much of the stories seemed too fantastical to be true, but there was enough about it that seemed possible that I wanted to learn more. I decided to read a little more about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;double-slit experiment&lt;/a&gt; that was referenced in &lt;em&gt;Constellation.&lt;/em&gt; What shocked me, while considering their need to entertain audiences, was how close to reality the storyline appeared to be.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;John Clauser, Alain Aspect, and Anton Zeilinger were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics. Their groundbreaking work was built upon one of the most significant discoveries in the history of physics: Bell’s Theorem, which was originally formulated by the late John Stewart Bell. In this video, we delve into the reasons why Bell’s Theorem stands as one of the most important and perplexing results in the annals of physics. Join us as we celebrate the achievements of these three remarkable scientists who, through their contributions, laid the foundation for cutting-edge technologies rooted in quantum information.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One of the more unsettling discoveries in the past half a century is that the universe is not locally real. In this context, “real” means that objects have definite properties independent of observation—an apple can be red even when no one is looking. “Local” means that objects can be influenced only by their surroundings and that any influence cannot travel faster than light. Investigations at the frontiers of quantum physics have found that these things cannot both be true. Instead the evidence shows that objects are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; influenced solely by their surroundings, and they &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; also lack definite properties prior to measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Entanglement is at the heart of quantum physics and future quantum technologies. Like other aspects of quantum science, the phenomenon of entanglement reveals itself at very tiny, subatomic scales. When two particles, such as a pair of photons or electrons, become entangled, they remain connected even when separated by vast distances. In the same way that a ballet or tango emerges from individual dancers, entanglement arises from the connection between particles. It is what scientists call an emergent property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way these articles describe reality seems counter-intuitive to my own senses. Things exist and always exist. But even in my own safe version of reality, I know that things are already weird. Light &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; instantaneous on Earth because it’s so small, relative to the universe. Yet when I look up in the sky I see ghosts. The light of long-dead stars might travel faster than any speed I could hope to reach, but it’s still incredibly outdated by the time it reaches my retinas. That feels impossible, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/david_deutsch_a_new_way_to_explain_explanation?subtitle=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;yet I already believe it to be true.&lt;/a&gt; What more could I not know that might be true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this isn’t interesting to everyone, but I have always found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/xxyqgx/what_does_the_universe_is_not_locally_real_mean/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;these kinds of conversations or discoveries deeply fascinating.&lt;/a&gt; I am in no way claiming to be a thought-leader or anywhere close to the intelligence level of those who are asking these questions or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuvK-od647c&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;providing the answers,&lt;/a&gt; but listening in on these sorts of discussions is what I’ve found the most fulfilling memories throughout my life. I deeply enjoy the unknown, and all of this is a new option that I hadn’t permitted myself to consider until now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/section&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pondering the ramifications to all this new data has been thrilling but also a little frightening. I’m still reading and trying to understand this new information. If every decision we make has the possibility of creating (even temporarily) a universe where any number of different reactions could have occurred is incredibly daunting to consider, because my identity and the consequences of my choices felt bound as a unique moment, not duplicatable. If every choice I make has a literal alternate reality out there, then am I really making a choice or am I making &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the choices and being bound by one? I only have knowledge of my choices and have only myself as the known version of my existence in the universe. I can continue to go on acting as if there was only ever one of me, but I don’t know how I’ll calm my nagging sense of uncertainty without better answers to my questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m reeling from the idea of multi-universes not just being the realm of fiction. Does this mean that energy is continually being generated since a universe is duplicated, or do all of these universes collapse into themselves after some time? Is there a “true” reality, like a single line with branching paths, or are we creating a fractal-like web of realities that have lost all sense of what came first?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to know what is happening in reality. I’ve not even fully understood the articles I’ve posted here and will have to go through them several more times to figure things out. This stuff has me feeling incredibly uneducated. Hamilton Nolan wrote in a recent article on his Substack &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hamiltonnolan.com/p/housing-is-the-economy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;How Things Work&lt;/a&gt; something that feels applicable to my current situation, even if it was about something rather different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even the experts barely understand what’s happening, and most of the loudest voices are just making stuff up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, while all that was going on in my head, I learned even more about the world that we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; see.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Attributing consciousness to animals based on their responses was seen as a cardinal sin. The argument went that projecting human traits, feelings, and behaviours onto animals had no scientific basis and there was no way of testing what goes on in animals’ minds.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But if new evidence emerges of animals’ abilities to feel and process what is going on around them, could that mean they are, in fact, conscious?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Our understanding of intelligence is always growing, but recent research has thrown a fascinating curveball: we’re discovering that plants are intelligent too. Though they might not look like creatures we typically describe as intelligent, plants can store information, solve problems, and develop complex social networks. This week, Adam sits with Zoë Shlanger, author of &lt;em&gt;The Light Eaters: How the Unseen World of Plant Intelligence Offers a New Understanding of Life on Earth,&lt;/em&gt; to explore this galaxy-brain concept of plant intelligence and what it means for how we see all life and our place in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned that hypotheses like these can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-consciousness-part-of-the-fabric-of-the-universe1/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;go to extremes&lt;/a&gt; that even in my current state of attempted open-mindedness I’m not yet ready to accept, but I do wonder if perhaps &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; things are conscious than we realize — and that &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; horrifies me a little bit. Are we truly in a cycle of murdering and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrXA_7OY0Ic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;eating each other&lt;/a&gt; every day, all the time? Plants were supposed to save us from harming living things, but now I’m wondering if &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Happening_(2008_film)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;M. Night was prescient.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so maybe the universe isn’t as permanent as I expected (please don’t be a simulation) and maybe everything is alive and mowing is actually really painful for plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m in a bit of a weakened state here. How much more of this new frontier of thought can I take?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/section&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s new to me. But what if it’s true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is where I find &lt;em&gt;Everything Everywhere All at Once&lt;/em&gt; to be of considerable help to my mental health. The film contains a moment where the two main characters &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXar2tNdG34&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;speak to each other in the form of rocks&lt;/a&gt; (it’s weird to write that out, but the sequence in the film is profound), talking about the perspective they now can share after seeing everything of every reality in existence. The mother character finally begins to form a solution to the problems that I and many others face when contemplating the absurdity of reality not being as permanent as one might believe, or that any numbers of realities might exist, or that we are life-destroying murder robots. A TikTok&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; user &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTNRJE3aq/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gives a good summary of the situation,&lt;/a&gt; though it still can be a little confusing, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTNRJ36EC/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;another TikTok user clarifies some terms.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m relived to know that there are many people who have come before me who have considered all these things. Some of this stuff has been deeply worrying until I was able to learn more. I’ve had questions about reality for a while now, and in the past I’d found solace from answers within my community or group. I’d even trained myself to run from the possibility of considering these questions, finding safety more in the bravado of claimed understanding, even while feeling deeply insecure. Some reading this may believe they have “ultimate” answers to questions such as mine, but I’ve found those types of responses less compelling when considering the breadth of groups or cultures making similar claims. I was raised to pursue truth, and that continues to remain my goal, but I also think I’ve found there is something exciting about uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Constellation&lt;/em&gt; was the superior of the two recent Apple TV+ shows to handle multiple universes; it felt too smart a show for people who regularly are using a second or third screen at the same time. Yeah, I’m being smug because I am upset that they cancelled the better show! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I think &lt;em&gt;Dark Matter,&lt;/em&gt; another multi-universe show also on Apple TV+, disproves that theory because it’s been rather disappointing for most of the season, and is in my opinion the clearly inferior of the two shows from the streaming service. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;For all the criticism it’s been receiving from the government (most likely just due to the amount of information being shared about what’s happening in Palestine), I have found TikTok deeply valuable for many areas of my life in ways that has surprised me. It’s not just a lip-syncing dance video app anymore. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Great programs that I enjoy</title>
        <author>David Hepworth</author>
        <description>
            &lt;p&gt;I always enjoy sharing with others some of the apps that I’ve discovered during my time as a MacOS user. Many of these apps were important reasons for me to shift from Windows to Mac. This is a rather exhaustive but not complete list of programs for Apple devices that I recommend. There may be Windows variants of these programs, but I don’t use them and can’t guarantee their quality.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I miss lockdown</title>
        <author>David Hepworth</author>
        <description>
            &lt;p&gt;I remember during the Covid-19 lockdown that I was surprisingly happy. I thought it was solely due to my misanthropic streak or that I was far more shy than I realized. However, after experiencing a couple of years of post-lockdown life (more so because Oklahoma was one of the defiantly anti-science states), I think my understanding of myself has grown and I now know why I felt so much better during Covid than I do now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years I have believed that I fully understood my psyche. But for as long as I was certain I knew myself best, I was also firm and vocal in my stance that I was introverted but not shy — and I think I’ve been wrong all this time. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellmind.com/scoptophobia-2671835&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I don’t like being seen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The fear of being perceived” explains much of my anxiety about so many elements of social interaction. I thought I was introverted, but I can throw aside all inhibitions when playing a character in front of others. When I’m online and hidden from a camera, I feel witty and energized. I don’t feel held back by my physicality like I do when I have to stand in front of someone and look at them in the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Articles about this have floated on the internet for years now without my knowledge, so this new revelation for me might be old for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what to do with this knowledge, though. I’ve battled with feeling isolated online because I’ve long felt that in-person relationships were superior. I don’t know if that is something that I feel or if that’s something that someone else has put in my head through years of pro-extroversion indoctrination. After considering that perhaps it might not be a moral wrong to be the way I am nor that being extroverted is a virtue, I think I at least take comfort in potentially knowing more why I feel the way I do.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My new old camera</title>
        <author>David Hepworth</author>
        <description>
            &lt;p&gt;For a period of time in my youth I fully expected to mature into an illustrator for children’s books. I found that pencils and charcoal were my favored tools, and I set about building my skills in the craft. The work was hard and I felt I was plateauing in mediocrity, increasing my doubts that I would ever manage to achieve the goals that I had set for myself. I perceived photography as an “easy” art form that I could comprehend, so I set about purchasing my first &lt;abbr title=&quot;Single Lens Reflex&quot;&gt;SLR&lt;/abbr&gt; to try out photography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had played with cameras in the past and found moments within my point-and-shoot use where I felt genuinely moved by some of the photographs I managed to capture, but I felt limited by the tools and wanted to improve the quality of my work. I took many photos with my 35mm SLR camera but the cost of processing the film frustrated my learning speed, so I was very pleased when I was able to afford a digital camera. While my first digital camera was only 2 megapixels and a point-and-shoot, I grew much in my understanding of laying out a scene and trying different angles because I could immediately see the results of my work on the back of the camera. I quickly grew frustrated by the limitations of the image quality and hoped for a chance to get something better, which eventually came in the form of a much-better digital SLR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way I was able to achieve these goals was by working for one-hour film processors and camera retailers that offered discounts to employees; some of the equipment I still own was purchased during those years. I was a horrible camera sales associate, but I appreciated being able to be around cameras and see the various ways the manufacturers improved the cameras each year. I noticed a continual drop in build quality and features in the low-end point-and-shoot models; combined with my desire to finally purchase a digital SLR, I began to have a heavy disdain for many of the cheap models the general public purchased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I made the right decision to pursue an SLR, but I missed out on the convenience of the point-and-shoot with my continued disdain for those models. With the advantage of time, I was able to look back at some of the better point-and-shoots that I missed, find one used at a terrific price, and get started on taking the random photos I would’ve been disappointed with if taken from my cellphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following photos were taken on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canon-powershot-sx150-is&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Canon PowerShot SX150 IS&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chdk.fandom.com/wiki/CHDK&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CHDK firmware&lt;/a&gt; to enable RAW shooting. In an indictment of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/06/mkbhd-post-processing-ruining-iphone-photos/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;photo quality of my iPhone 13 mini,&lt;/a&gt; this camera takes pictures that I like, even if I have to put more effort into importing them into my Apple Photos collection. While I haven’t taken the next award-winning photograph with this camera, I have enjoyed being able to have something readily available that doesn’t look threatening or suspicious and ends up taking a photo I might want to share with someone.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My fun side project</title>
        <author>David Hepworth</author>
        <description>
            &lt;h3 id=&quot;inspired-by-the-2020-apple-event&quot;&gt;Inspired by the 2020 Apple event&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked the aesthetic of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/live/KR0g-1hnQPA?si=AmHCsABjAVYTHXmf&amp;amp;t=3763&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;advertisement for the iPhone 12 Pro that Apple did years ago.&lt;/a&gt; I wanted to remake it in HTML as much as I could, so I used this project to build a list of links to my social network profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I wanted to get the colors of the sunrise from the video, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cssgradient.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;so I went to a tool online,&lt;/a&gt; and uploaded a cropped shot of the sky to grab the colors from it to make a linear-gradient. I tweaked the results and set it up on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make the gradient image appear more filmic, I used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/grainy-gradients/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tool mentioned by CSS-Tricks&lt;/a&gt; to build an SVG file of noise for use as a mask-image in CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then went back to the video and captured a screenshot of the mountain range, tracing over the resulting image in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vectornator.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vectornator.&lt;/a&gt; I customized it to be wider and more varied, experimenting with horizon level, until I exported a final SVG that I then compressed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://imageoptim.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ImageOptim.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, for the stars in the sky I went to NASA and browsed their image gallery until I found an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/the-city-lights-at-the-intersection-of-europe-and-asia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;appropriate photo of stars.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then built the CSS with animations, filters, gradients, mask-images, and shadows to make a glimmering interface.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Knowledge shouldn’t be a burden</title>
        <author>David Hepworth</author>
        <description>
            &lt;p&gt;I call myself an introvert &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vipshek.com/blog/interaction&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;but I wonder sometimes if I’m wrong.&lt;/a&gt; I like to talk a lot, just only about a few things. I deeply enjoy sharing with someone else what I have learned about my favorite subjects. I think learning is a social act, with the reward of learning something being the opportunity to share that new understanding with someone else. What is to be done when some knowledge is seen as a threat? Gaining that sort of knowledge transforms an exhilarating social act into an incredibly effective form of self-isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge seems amoral to me, and learning seems to be as close to a virtue as one could consider. Yet I too, despite my hunger to learn more, can recall with pangs of guilt the council of my youth that considered the act of learning a path riddled with danger, prone to leading a person to destruction if they were not careful. Some things were seen as so antagonistic to a learner that even an idle consideration of such things was a flirtation with the unethical. There was hidden enemy around every paragraph of unapproved text. &lt;a href=&quot;/post/2022/02/03/anxious-about-being-ignorant.html&quot;&gt;I didn’t want to remain ignorant&lt;/a&gt;, but learning even the smallest new piece of information seems to carry a huge cost to a vast array of elements in my life. Could I find a way to feel comfort in understanding more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am fairly certain that I now know why such a practice of fear of knowledge is fostered in some communities: it is essential to that community’s continued existence that its adherents avoid the pursuit of individual and unguided learning. To learn for oneself is to seek out truth without a stranger’s heavy hand guiding one’s conclusions toward a definitive goal. To understand the complexity of things is to unearth shades of gray instead of the stark contrast of dogma. I could sense that breaking through this programming would be to my benefit, but every step forward felt like a violation. Not everyone wants to take those steps, and that’s where my isolation begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;article-snippet&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;embedtool&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oDQXFNWuZj8&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player — Bo Burnham: How the World Works&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;how-the-world-works&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-qj2rqgChM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;How the World Works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here’s a happy little song about the world sung by Bo Burnham and his special friend, Socko.
&lt;em&gt;Bo Burnham: Inside&lt;/em&gt; is streaming now on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not a scholar, I’ve done no independent research, and my recall of details is still often dependent on the bookmarks and search results that I’ve saved over the years. I don’t claim to be a subject matter expert in potentially any area. I am not a better person than someone else because I have read a book. My self-actualization isn’t the element that will redeem the world or is of much value to someone else. Yet I still really enjoy becoming more educated in an increasing number of the subjects most interesting to me. In some of these subjects I have found vast stretches of information new to me that have thrilled me in their discovery. I have longed for an opportunity to share or discuss this information, but what I have learned is that with each new piece of information, I have inadvertently isolated myself. First, there is a shared language lost in this learning. What seemed obvious and beyond debate to me before now feels open to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/04/AR2006030401369.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;skepticism and consideration,&lt;/a&gt; so I no longer have a solid shared foundation on which to call in conversations. Even agreements on simple definitions have to be made first in order to have a conversation. Secondly, I have found that this knowledge, because of how interesting it is, increases specialization and focus on elements which may not be as interesting or desired by others. This limits my potential conversational opportunities over time, increasing my chances of loneliness. Thirdly, sharing this information triggers the listener with the same anxieties I faced in my youthful culture of fear, making me become an enemy instead of a curious reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that I’m reading too cold and analytical in this post. I don’t know how to share more. I think I’m just coping and trying to survive with what I’ve learned. There are times where I wonder if that phrase “ignorance is bliss” may be one of the wisest words ever written. I like knowing so much more about life and the complexities of cultures and governments, but it weighs me down to see how much more pain there is in the world than I realized and how I likely directly contributed to its continuation. I think we could all empathize with each other more by being better educated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did all this knowledge change me for the better or has it ruined me? I feel that I can &lt;a href=&quot;/post/2021/10/26/an-identity-crisis.html&quot;&gt;love so much better and more deeply than before,&lt;/a&gt; but now I feel more lonely when I would have expected to feel closer to community. I am both the same person and yet very different. I &lt;a href=&quot;/post/2022/06/10/feeling-stuck.html&quot;&gt;still see the same world as before&lt;/a&gt; but my definitions have changed and my expectations of &lt;a href=&quot;/post/2021/11/26/we-arent-asking-the-right-questions.html&quot;&gt;what is acceptable have been altered&lt;/a&gt;. My goals of loving others are still there, but the methods aren’t what they were. Having all this within me keeps me feeling both the best I’ve ever felt and the worst I hope to ever experience. I have fantasized sometimes about having my memory wiped and what that would mean for me, but I don’t think I could do it. I prize my experiences but I wish I had more people around me with whom to share it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might conclude that I should have accepted the advice from those who warned me not to tread in these spaces, but I believe that the struggle to learn is always the better solution to ignorance, even when it carries a heavy cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Something interesting happens when you realize your generation isn’t the center of the discourse anymore. I’m not even talking about being the locus of cool. More like: you just seem to matter less. People are less anxious about you, less mad about you — if anything, they seem slightly annoyed by you. You’re no longer the future. You’re the well-worn middle.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today we take it for granted that God has no body. But the psalmists had other views. “Praise Yahweh, for he is lovely looking!” cries one psalmist; another longed to live in the Jerusalem temple all the days of his life, “to behold the beauty of Yahweh … your face, Yahweh, do I seek.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Being invisible</title>
        <author>David Hepworth</author>
        <description>
            &lt;p&gt;When we moved into our new house, my wife and I decided to purchase a couple seed packs of flowers to put in a garden in the back yard. We chose to purchase native wildflowers; we thought they would have the greatest chance of surviving and the variety of seeds included promised to provide a lot of colors and shapes of blossoms. We were overwhelmed by the assortment when they bloomed in the spring, and marveled at how beautiful and unique each flower was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was potentially even more stunning to us was the classification of “weed” for most of what grew. What we saw as incredibly valuable was deemed by others to be a nuisance, a plant worthy of destruction. We could not fully understand how someone could see such a gorgeous assortment and classify them in such low esteem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realization that value could be so wide in its interpretation was on my mind as I considered my internal image of myself. From my youth I have worked to lessen my consideration of my own value, thinking it a virtue to self-deprecate. I have self-assigned my personal contributions to work assignments and relationships to be of such a minimal worth because I thought it would be prideful to believe or accept any other interpretation. I ignored the compliments of others. I dismissed the evaluations of my worth unless it was at least as bad as my own estimation. I thought I was being a better person by hating myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet as I considered my prized flowers that others would deem repulsive, I wondered if my self-perception could be incorrect. Could I be poisoning my life with such a crushing view of myself? Could I be assigning the status of “weed” to my life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years I have battled the dissonance of wanting to be successful, which would result in some level of notoriety, with the ingrained view that any level of fame is a potential moral failing because being noticed could inevitably lead to pride and destruction of self. I chose invisibility as the default: better to be the wallflower and be a “good person” than to be popular and turn out a monster. Yet I found no joy in being unknown, for anonymity seemed cursed with an impotence to improve the lives of others. I was no superhero with vast caches of money or super-human abilities to hide my identity while greatly impacting others; instead, I was just hiding in the shadows of my community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How was this misery and near-constant depression anything but a wasted life? I was making little of the changes that I aimed to make as a young adult. I was severely dependent on a few friendships that I constantly chided myself for having and regularly believed to be a case of pity for a slug like me. I was regularly rejecting the value that others assigned to me, inadvertently insulting them by throwing away the compliments they sent to me was a poor judgement of my character. I was being frivolous with the gifts of friendships and community because I thought it better to deprive myself of their joys — even guilty for feeling any sense of happiness. What a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now aim to see my life as I see my flowers: they are valuable just by existing, waiting to be seen by others who also see their worth. They will not be treasured by hiding their petals: they must take the risk of being harmed or misrepresented by boldly throwing open their blossoms and calling for the attention of the creatures who will love them. There is no virtue in hiding; there is no absolute moral good in being invisible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The memories I hold closest to me are the ones where people noticed me and loved me. There was a measure of shame associated with enjoying those memories, because I felt that it was wrong to be loved — I was, after all, supposed to avoid such feelings lest I fall to pride and vanity. But how can I find value in other humans if the one human I know the most — myself — I hate with such passion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to see myself, like a flower, as being worthy of love. I know that I am not going to be loved by all, just as a weed may be culled by some and kept by others, but I think that the goal of finding some who see your beauty is worth the pain of being undervalued by others. I think that if I can start seeing myself as valuable and accepting that others can feel the same, I will be far more capable of sharing that same kind of love to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a simple flower can find the courage to be visible, why not I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Old grey-haired waitresses&lt;br /&gt;
In cafes at night&lt;br /&gt;
Have given it up,&lt;br /&gt;
And as i walk down sidewalks of light&lt;br /&gt;
And look into windows of nursing homes&lt;br /&gt;
I can see that it is no longer with them.&lt;br /&gt;
I see people sitting on park benches&lt;br /&gt;
And i can see by the way they sit and look&lt;br /&gt;
That it is gone.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I see people driving cars&lt;br /&gt;
And I see by the way&lt;br /&gt;
They drive their cars&lt;br /&gt;
That they neither love nor are loved –&lt;br /&gt;
Nor do they consider sex.&lt;br /&gt;
It is all forgotten&lt;br /&gt;
Like an old movie.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I see people in department stores and supermarkets&lt;br /&gt;
Walking down aisles&lt;br /&gt;
Buying things&lt;br /&gt;
And i can see by the way their clothing&lt;br /&gt;
Fits them and by the way they walk&lt;br /&gt;
And by their faces and their eyes&lt;br /&gt;
That they care for nothing&lt;br /&gt;
And that nothing cares for them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I see a hundred people a day&lt;br /&gt;
Who have given up entirely.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If I go to the racetrack  or a sporting event&lt;br /&gt;
I can see thousands that feel for nothing&lt;br /&gt;
Or no one&lt;br /&gt;
And get no feeling back.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Everywhere I see those who&lt;br /&gt;
Crave nothing but food, shelter, and clothing;&lt;br /&gt;
They concentrate on that,&lt;br /&gt;
Dreamlessly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I do not understand why these people do not&lt;br /&gt;
vanish&lt;br /&gt;
I do not understand why these people do not&lt;br /&gt;
expire&lt;br /&gt;
Why the clouds do not murder them&lt;br /&gt;
Or why the dogs do not murder them&lt;br /&gt;
Or why the flowers and the children do not murder them,&lt;br /&gt;
I do not understand.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I suppose they are murdered&lt;br /&gt;
Yet i can’t adjust to the&lt;br /&gt;
Fact of them&lt;br /&gt;
Because they are so many.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Each day,&lt;br /&gt;
Each night,&lt;br /&gt;
There are more of them&lt;br /&gt;
In the subways and&lt;br /&gt;
In the buildings and&lt;br /&gt;
In the parks&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;They feel no terror&lt;br /&gt;
At not loving&lt;br /&gt;
Or at not&lt;br /&gt;
Being loved&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;So many many many&lt;br /&gt;
Of my fellow creatures&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here’s a map out of the wilderness.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Worrying about the state of our men is an American tradition. But today’s problems are real and well documented.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The culture in which I was raised had specific traits and responsibilities imposed on the sexes. One who strayed too far from those characteristics was threatening one’s own status as that sex. I was never comfortable adjusting my personality to fit that mold, so I spent years of my life feeling like a nomad among the cultural norms, morally, mentally, and physically failing the expectations of the system. I didn’t want to follow the traditional expectations of masculinity because many of them remain troubling to me. So much about being a man seemed built as a constrast to the traits of a woman, but handled primarily in an antagonistic and domineering manner that was used as a tool to humiliate and objectify women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeking an alternative to this system has been difficult. I feel conditioned to see differences where none may exist. I still feel anxious that I don’t have a specific list of unique qualities that would define me as a man, even though I never felt a connection to nor felt any comfort in being limited to such a list. I doubt my value without those characteristics as a tool to define me. It is as if I lack an identity if I can’t compare myself to a set of qualities that someone else chose for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think the solution is to seek the answers from someone like Jordan Peterson or Joe Rogan; that seems to be a return to restricting my life to someone else’s definition of what it is to be a man. I’m not convinced that any list is actually necessary to my life in the way it once seemed. I think I want to rearrange my list of my identity and place “man” in a mere attribute of me rather than the word under which everything is defined. I think handling it this way will mean I no longer try to consider how a “man” would approach a situation and instead let “David” (that’s me) get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What is church?</title>
        <author>David Hepworth</author>
        <description>
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does the average American Evangelical attend church? What are their goals, and do they find those goals met?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My history in the Christian church began in my childhood. Most of the sermons I heard came from my father, standing near (but not behind — his personal preference) the pulpit of whatever church we were attending at the time. My father pastored several churches throughout my time in the family home, sometimes in church buildings and sometimes in the house of one of the people in attendance. I love my experiences in those years and the communities that formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a bit of an adversarial approach to other churches in the community. I matured in a somewhat sequestered monoculture, often not being exposed to denominations or viewpoints that didn’t match those of my mentors. As a result, I saw anyone else who disagreed with me as being sadly misinformed to morally degraded, so I kept to my community because I was certain that we were what remained of “true Christians.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I retained this mindset even after leaving the family home and moving across the country to Oklahoma for a job. For about a year I continued to live-stream my father’s sermons because I was certain that there was no other decent church available, even in the “Bible Belt” of Oklahoma. When I finally felt it was time to build a community of friends in my local community, I visited with deep trepidation my first non-denominational church in my life and the first non-father-led church in years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I had a few prickly moments of uncertainty about the methods of the sermons and the culture of and practices in the church, I discovered that I appreciated learning different views on Bible verses and stories. I began to better understand the differences between denominations and doctrines and why they were a struggle for so many. I met my wife at this time and we both began regularly attending this church with our friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we began attending a small group, where we had our own little Bible study time and then casual conversation around a few snacks. The church didn’t have a good structure around small groups, so when that small group’s leaders chose to step away from their roles, the process to reintegrate felt chaotic and mostly hopeless. After finding little success in forming a new group and tiring of the sermons that had begun to feel confined in their scope and study, we moved to a new church farther down the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new church didn’t have small groups outside of church hours but instead had “Sunday School,” in the sense that the small groups attended either right before or after the sermon on Sunday. This felt like a step backward in terms of building a community, so it was on to the next church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new church had wildly different views on Christian doctrine, so that was a short-lived visit. Besides, it was time to move to Houston for a new job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process continued in Houston. The experiences were the same when we returned to Oklahoma. I shared with my wife my beloved memories of childhood church attendance, but we couldn’t find a match in culture in any of the churches I attended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was my childhood mentality of the American church being weak being proven true? Had I made a decade-long mistake in choosing to give any one of these churches a chance? Were the only good churches those found in my past? Or was there perhaps a deeper problem of which I was only now becoming aware?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;readmore&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;church-as-a-place-of-learning&quot;&gt;Church as a place of learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have many deeply important memories of the intense Biblical debates I observed or in which I participated during my childhood. My father was often involved in them, and through him I formed much of what I believed to be true about the Bible and the manner in which it should be interpreted. Effectively starting my life as an empty vessel, I filled it with the teaching of my father and those around him, and I heard that teaching spoken often. When I left home I felt confident in my righteousness and certain that what I believed was the most obvious viewpoint one could have and that all good people would share that view. What I discovered in other churches deeply challenged my understanding of the Christian community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other denominations and viewpoints within the Evangelical Christian churches weren’t based on malicious interpretations as I had expected. People weren’t actively rebelling against my view of the Bible as I had declared in my past. Every church member was behaving in a way that they thought was proper and striving to meet the standards that they believed were set for them through the text of the Bible and the church culture that they preferred. Denominational differences were based on reasoning that appeared sound for both sides. My understanding of the Bible was just one of many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the diversity of opinion was exciting, it got me wondering: if all these groups read the same text but came to different and equally confident conclusions, then how could I really claim to be certain that what I believed was the best interpretation? I didn’t know these viewpoints existed until I started visiting these churches and I had only seen a small selection, but one of them had to be true, right? It seemed mathematically conclusive that at least one of the churches in existence had the fully proper interpretation of the Bible. Was one of those churches in my proximity, or were all the churches around me teaching at least one falsehood?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/960863-until-every-soul-is-freely-permitted-to-investigate-every-book&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is amazing to me that a difference of opinion upon subjects that we know nothing with certainty about, should make us hate, persecute, and despise each other. Why a difference of opinion upon predestination, or the trinity, should make people imprison and burn each other seems beyond the comprehension of man; and yet in all countries where Christians have existed, they have destroyed each other to the exact extent of their power.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Robert G. Ingersoll — &lt;em&gt;Mistakes of Moses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A multitude of questions started to flow through my mind, overwhelming me and leading to great distress. What were the pastors not telling me? Was a pastor from a seminary a more reliable or a more biased source? Was a confident pastor an ignorant one or a learned one? If I was visiting churches looking for one that seemed “right” to me, was I really looking to learn or just confirm my own presuppositions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major moment of change for me was when I learned of the long-fought debate between people who based their faith on free will versus those who believed in determinism. My early interactions in this area were watching debates on YouTube between James White and Leighton Flowers, who passionately and regularly sniped back and forth about the exclusively correct state of their opposing interpretations of the Bible. Mr. White tended to boast of the ancestral credentials to his viewpoint, following the lineage of the view back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/06/19/how-st-augustine-invented-sex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aurelius Augustinus,&lt;/a&gt; an angst-ridden man who tortured himself with worries about his moral state with God, and Mr. Flowers’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Potters-Promise-Biblical-Traditional-Soteriology/dp/0692561846&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;viewpoint&lt;/a&gt; which focused more on how God couldn’t be a loving god while also purposely creating people intended to be doomed to eternal punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was alarming to me in watching and reading their reasoning was discovering that &lt;em&gt;they were both correct&lt;/em&gt;. They had very good points on which to base their views and verse after verse to support them. The whole reason the debate had continued for so long was because the writers in the Bible &lt;em&gt;also had differing views&lt;/em&gt;. The disagreements between the founders of Christianity are documented within the Bible, never mind the centuries of councils and denominations that formed based on those differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misquoting_Jesus&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In sum, a number of passages in our surviving manuscripts appear to embody the apologetic concerns of the early Christians, especially as these relate to the founder of their faith, Jesus himself. Just as with theological conflicts in the early church, the question of the role of women, and the controversies with the Jews, so too with the disputes raging between Christians and their cultured despisers among the pagans: all of these controversies came to affect the texts that were eventually to become part of the book that we now call the New Testament, as this book—or rather, this set of books—was compiled by nonprofessional scribes in the second and third centuries, and occasionally came to be altered in light of the contexts of their day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Bart D. Ehrman — &lt;em&gt;Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t find the answers to my questions in any of the churches I attended; instead, I only witnessed apologetics for one position or the other, argued in a vacuum with the opposition as a boogeyman. Every verse was bent and twisted to fit one harmonious view, only to be distorted in the opposite way to fit the contrasting view in the church across the street. One &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/texas-pastor-says-gay-people-shot-back-head-shocking-sermon-rcna32748&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;church could be lead by a pastor wishing to kill gay people&lt;/a&gt; while another &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandan_Robertson&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;church could be employing a gay pastor.&lt;/a&gt; Some pastors might advocate for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://southsidechurchofchrist.com/sermons/hellfire-and-brimstone.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;eternal torture of sinners&lt;/a&gt; for their finite faults committed during their life; some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/11/26/the-hell-raiser-3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;that there is no Hell;&lt;/a&gt; others might claim that &lt;a href=&quot;https://reknew.org/2008/01/the-case-for-annihilationism/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hell is misunderstood;&lt;/a&gt; some might attest that the issue is moot because everyone &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOzmwGmiDHQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;can&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universalist_Church_of_America&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;will&lt;/a&gt; eventually go to Heaven. Each view would claim divine authority and would have enough Biblical support to be convincing to &lt;em&gt;those seeking that particular viewpoint&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began to understand that if I were to stay within just the learning experience of a church sermon, I would have to accept that the source of my understanding of the Bible would likely largely stay within myself. I was like every other church member: unconsciously forming the interpretation of the Bible based on a personal worldview and then seeking out a church that would confirm that view through selective reading of Bible passages. That is a comforting state to many and one that I experienced for many years of my life, but I wanted to understand more. I was worried that I wasn’t going to find a reliable informational source within the walls of a church. I sought out wider opinions from scholars, historians, and philosophers who had a greater amount of experience in not only the matters of the Bible but the context in which it was written and the societies around it during its formation. I wanted a more scientific method of discovery where opinions could be tested in a more public forum. Once I realized that there was so much more to learn about the Bible than what one denomination or another could offer or allow, and that deeper thought was actually rather widely available, I knew that a church would likely never again be a place of learning for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;church-as-a-community-center&quot;&gt;Church as a community center&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When moving to a new neighborhood where no friends or family live, one might ask a local how they found and formed their own friendships. In Oklahoma, the primary response one should expect is to attend a church. Church is often where people claim to have met some of their deepest and most meaningful connections. In my experience, many people might be saying it, but few are living it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A church sermon isn’t really the place for one to have a conversation with even the person in the next seat, so church leaders came up with the solution: church, but smaller, in the form of meetings with a limited selection of church members who share common interests or stages of life. Nearly every church I’ve visited has encouraged the assembly of smaller groups of church members to meet within the church building on Sunday or within each other’s homes during the week. Usually the suggestion is to attend all options provided: a community group and a sermon on Sunday morning and a small group at some point during the week. These groups usually convene in the form of a “Bible study,” where a group leader reads the Bible and then pilots discussion afterwards. Sometimes the studies involve the same book as what is being discussed in the sermon on Sunday morning, and sometimes the sermon itself is the focus of discussion. The purpose of these groups is to build friendships with a selection of church members and to keep the Bible as a priority throughout the week. Pastors will often say that the sermon may be a place where someone gets to learn about the faith, but that the effects of that sermon and the community to support the changes that it produces are found within a community group and small group. One pastor I heard went so far as to say that very little value could be produced from exclusively attending church on Sunday morning; community groups were that essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of these community groups is to build deep friendships with the others who attend, share painful moments from the week with them, and then receive or give encouragement. But these aren’t friends, they’re strangers. Meeting for an hour or two a week &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0265407518761225&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;will not produce friendships.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0265407518761225&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Casual friendships emerge around 30 hr, followed by friendships around 50 hr. Good friendships begin to emerge after 140 hr. Best friendships do not emerge until after 300 hr of time spent. Whether spending 30 or 600 hr of time together, the percentage of all relationships formed in closed systems (e.g., work, school) remains relatively constant. Logistic regressions offered 3-point estimates: 94 hr when acquaintances become casual friends, 164 hr when casual friends become friends, and 219 hr when friends become good/best friends. These numbers are likely conservative estimates due to the inclusion of both closed system and chosen relationships and due to the retrospective nature of the study. It is quite likely that the friendship status transitioned to a higher level before these cut-point estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jeffrey A. Hall — &lt;em&gt;How many hours does it take to make a friend?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the community groups that tend to succeed don’t prosper because the members met &lt;em&gt;in the community group&lt;/em&gt;, they prosper because the people attending met and became good friends &lt;em&gt;before forming their own community group&lt;/em&gt;. The community group doesn’t appear to regularly be the catalyst for the formation of a community, but rather the byproduct of one built elsewhere. This pre-existing friendship makes it incredibly hard for new community group members to break through, either requiring a separate clique of new members becoming acquaintances or forever feeling like an outsider among the community. If there isn’t enough growth within the community — and due to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/19/opinion/religion-america.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;decreasing numbers of churchgoers,&lt;/a&gt; that is often the case — then the general expectation I have for community groups is the slow withering of new members who quietly leave and never return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Church isn’t the place to build community, but it’s often cited as such. What options are available to those who no longer see church in that way and who seek an alternative? The choices seem limited, in part because enough churchgoers see church as the ultimate source of community, rejecting many other legitimate and perhaps superior methods available to them even if their preferred meeting choice of a church isn’t leading to a thriving base of friendships. For some, leaving that hub to instead experience long periods of loneliness and uncertainty is too painful; but for others like me, staying within a broken system is even worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;church-as-a-cultural-example&quot;&gt;Church as a cultural example&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10426666-in-the-end-doug-wilson-john-piper-mark-driscoll-james&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the end, Doug Wilson, John Piper, Mark Driscoll, James Dobson, Doug Phillips, and John Eldredge all preached a mutually reinforcing vision of Christian masculinity—of patriarchy and submission, sex and power. It was a vision that promised protection for women but left women without defense, one that worshiped power and turned a blind eye to justice, and one that transformed the Jesus of the Gospels into an image of their own making. Though rooted in different traditions and couched in different styles, their messages blended together to become the dominant chord in the cacophony of evangelical popular culture. And they had been right all along. The militant Christian masculinity they practiced and preached did indelibly shape both family and nation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Kristin Kobes DuMez — &lt;em&gt;Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up I heard Christians say that churches make up (or should make up) for the social services that are lacking from state and federal government, so that charitable giving to churches was a net good as that money was then sent out into the community. &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/conservative-myth-social-safety-net-120000203.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;That belief may not be fully grounded in reality,&lt;/a&gt; but it is a useful example for the point that I’m trying to make. Churches are often depicted, at least in the areas where I’ve lived, as a moral example to the rest of the world. Real love, guidance, companionship, and mentoring can be found only in a church, or so the claims go. I used to believe there may be some credence to these claims, but I find them pretty dubious now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Churches claim moral supremacy, but they regularly prove themselves to be incredibly dangerous outlets for repressed emotions. Despite the origin of Christianity being founded within the oppressed and weak, modern churches share a legacy and continued reputation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/religious-right-real-origins-107133/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bigotry and hatred of minorities.&lt;/a&gt; Pastors regularly advocate for a political party that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republicans-voting-against-their-own-interests-its_b_596cec66e4b07f87578e6ab7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;actively harms its constituents&lt;/a&gt; with a leader who &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump#Misogyny_and_allegations_of_sexual_misconduct&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;flagrantly violates the lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; that Christians deem acceptable to their god. Church leaders &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/illinois-catholic-church-child-abuse-rcna86289&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;regularly commit sexual assault&lt;/a&gt; against their followers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2022/06/02/1102621352/how-the-southern-baptist-convention-covered-up-its-widespread-sexual-abuse-scand&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;infrastructure exists to keep it hidden.&lt;/a&gt; Some pastors can’t manage to say the phrase &lt;a href=&quot;https://whatwouldyousay.org/should-christians-support-black-lives-matter/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Black Lives Matter”&lt;/a&gt; without at least a caveat. During Covid-19, churches were sources of misinformation and anti-science sentiment, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/united-house-of-prayer-for-all-people-in-charlotte-north-carolina-spread-coronavirus-locals-say&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;leading to numerous deaths from super-spreader events.&lt;/a&gt; Churches offer mentoring, but not the variety that is based on science intended to aid those in need, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportskeeda.com/pop-culture/epic-cult-vibes-james-river-church-tank-video-goes-viral-leaves-internet-disbelief&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;unless one is to believe that monster trucks teach men how to be decent humans.&lt;/a&gt; One churchgoer was so frustrated by the lack of good leadership for men in his church that &lt;a href=&quot;https://truemanlifecoaching.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he started his own non-profit&lt;/a&gt; to assist men who felt they didn’t get proper leadership from their churches. These are training tools &lt;em&gt;for men&lt;/em&gt;, by far the most favored sex in the patriarchal complementarian view most churches prefer. Women instead receive the special treatment of an extra dose of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.choosingtherapy.com/purity-culture/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;purity culture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/southern-baptist-convention-sex-abuse.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;victim blaming.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10899605-ironically-complementarian-theology-claims-it-is-defending-a-plain-and&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Ironically, complementarian theology claims it is defending a plain and natural interpretation of the Bible while really defending an interpretation that has been corrupted by our sinful human drive to dominate others and build hierarchies of power and oppression. I can’t think of anything less Christlike than hierarchies like these.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Beth Allison Barr — &lt;em&gt;The Making of Biblical Womanhood: How the Subjugation of Women Became Gospel Truth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over and over and &lt;em&gt;over and &lt;strong&gt;over&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; again churches do not behave in the way that they say they do. Some will admit to this hypocrisy, but refer to their poor behavior as “their mess,” a euphemism for the same type of behavior for which others outside the church are condemned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I certainly understand why people within the churches feel that they have the best of everything within their culture, but it’s because they’ve been conditioned to never step outside of that bubble. They’ve been trained to believe that their neighbor is “the enemy” if they don’t follow the church’s exact blend of philosophical or doctrinal standards. They’ve been indoctrinated to never seek answers outside of a certain circle of speakers, even though there is an abundance of scholarship available for free to anyone with a library card or an internet connection. Christians have been told to live in constant fear by the very people helping to engender that anxiety, and to give their money and their bodies to the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-church&quot;&gt;What is church?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be able to honestly answer the question I raised in the title of this post, but I know I’m terribly biased these days against the church. I didn’t find that it followed through on its promises and I don’t like feeling lied to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-no-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;flex-item&quot; style=&quot;aspect-ratio: 16/9&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/A2ttSv7I9HY&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Churches are spaces where one man may share his worldview in a position of authority and use an ancient collection of texts to support that position. If enough people like hearing their own worldview confidently repeated back to them, then the pastor becomes popular and the viewpoint becomes the more accepted position for moderate Christians. The text of the Bible contains sections of letters that share this tension amongst its followers, even in its early stages of formation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%204:3-4&amp;amp;version=NASB&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For the time will come when they will not tolerate sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance with their own desires, and they will turn their ears away from the truth and will turn aside to myths.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Timothy 4:3 (New American Standard Version)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or in this passage, where Paul, who repeatedly made the claim that his particular viewpoint was directly inspired by God and therefore the only complete and accurate viewpoint, makes this observation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+1%3A10-12&amp;amp;version=NASB&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Now I urge you, brothers and sisters, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment. For I have been informed concerning you, my brothers and sisters, by Chloe’s people, that there are quarrels among you. Now I mean this, that each one of you is saying, “I am with Paul,” or “I am with Apollos,” or “I am with Cephas,” or “I am with Christ.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Corinthians 1:10–12 (New American Standard Version)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pauline view of Christianity prevailed through centuries of debate, inspiring later followers like Augustine and Martin Luther to further expand upon his foundations and build a devoted following throughout the centuries. Other viewpoints, existing within the Bible and throughout history, have fought and lost the battle for public acceptance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcion_of_Sinope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;branded as heretical.&lt;/a&gt; That this opinion was swayed by the current events of the time is rarely accepted among Christian churches, who advocate for divine inspiration throughout generations as the reasoning for the evolving standards of the faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Churches could be a forum for discussion on how to adapt the faith to the era in which is it currently being spoken, or a safe area to discuss the Bible and the complexities of its interpretations without judgement, but it is instead a machine for dogmatic thought and unquestioning application. Questioning is doubt, and doubt that doesn’t lead to a result that the church favors is ultimately a sin, so people choose to be told what to think rather than risk being seen as a sinner. Learning about the Bible’s history outside of the walls of a church has been far more interesting to me because I’ve been able to explore all lines of thought without judgement by a pastor or community group. The result is that I have been able to understand far more about the Bible, its history, and the impact it has had on the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/960965-let-us-forget-that-we-are-baptists-methodists-catholics-presbyterians&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let us forget that we are Baptists, Methodists, Catholics, Presbyterians, or Free-thinkers, and remember only that we are men and women. After all, man and woman are the highest possible titles. All other names belittle us, and show that we have, to a certain extent, given up our individuality, and have consented to wear the collar of authority—that we are followers. Throwing away these names, let us examine these questions not as partisans, but as human beings with hopes and fears in common.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Robert G. Ingersoll — &lt;em&gt;Mistakes of Moses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I can answer what church is by advocating for what it shouldn’t be: a hurdle to being a decent human being. As soon as a pastor or a denomination starts setting rules in place that seem to be getting in the way of being loving to others or asking difficult questions with uncomfortable answers, I believe that it’s in everyone’s best interest to choose something different to do on a Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is Christian fundamentalism and when did Christians start teaching fundamentalism? The movement of Fundamentalism comes during struggles between faith and science, as the teachings of Darwin and others began to concern Christians as it appeared to undermine their understanding of the Bible. This video tells the story of the Scopes Monkey Trial, the publishing of The Christian Fundamentals, and the ensuing culture war between certain Christians and intellectual culture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the modern world we’re very comfortable with the Conservative versus Liberal splits that are part and parcel of the church, not only in the West but around the globe. We use words like “fundamentalist,” “progressive,” “liberal,” and a host of others as a way of signaling the split. But, I can say as a teacher of history, the more I look around the world today the more I realize that people tend to believe or they maybe assume that many of these splits are a product of the 20th century, or maybe they go back a good bit before that to the early enlightenment itself. Well, of either of those two extremes the history is not on their side.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
