        <description>
            &lt;p&gt;I always enjoy sharing with others some of the apps that I‚Äôve discovered during my time as a MacOS user. Many of these apps were important reasons for me to shift from Windows to Mac. This is a rather exhaustive but not complete list of programs for Apple devices that I recommend. There may be Windows variants of these programs, but I don‚Äôt use them and can‚Äôt guarantee their quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programs listed below in italics are my &lt;em&gt;favorite&lt;/em&gt; favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I miss lockdown</title>
        <author>David Hepworth</author>
        <description>
            &lt;p&gt;I remember during the Covid-19 lockdown that I was surprisingly happy. I thought it was solely due to my misanthropic streak or that I was far more shy than I realized. However, after experiencing a couple of years of post-lockdown life (more so because Oklahoma was one of the defiantly anti-science states), I think my understanding of myself has grown and I now know why I felt so much better during Covid than I do now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years I have believed that I fully understood my psyche. But for as long as I was certain I knew myself best, I was also firm and vocal in my stance that I was introverted but not shy ‚Äî and I think I‚Äôve been wrong all this time. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellmind.com/scoptophobia-2671835&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I don‚Äôt like being seen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe fear of being perceived‚Äù explains much of my anxiety about so many elements of social interaction. I thought I was introverted, but I can throw aside all inhibitions when playing a character in front of others. When I‚Äôm online and hidden from a camera, I feel witty and energized. I don‚Äôt feel held back by my physicality like I do when I have to stand in front of someone and look at them in the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Articles about this have floated on the internet for years now without my knowledge, so this new revelation for me might be old for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know what to do with this knowledge, though. I‚Äôve battled with feeling isolated online because I‚Äôve long felt that in-person relationships were superior. I don‚Äôt know if that is something that I feel or if that‚Äôs something that someone else has put in my head through years of pro-extroversion indoctrination. After considering that perhaps it might not be a moral wrong to be the way I am nor that being extroverted is a virtue, I think I at least take comfort in potentially knowing more why I feel the way I do.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My new old camera</title>
        <author>David Hepworth</author>
        <description>
            &lt;p&gt;For a period of time in my youth I fully expected to mature into an illustrator for children‚Äôs books. I found that pencils and charcoal were my favored tools, and I set about building my skills in the craft. The work was hard and I felt I was plateauing in mediocrity, increasing my doubts that I would ever manage to achieve the goals that I had set for myself. I perceived photography as an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù art form that I could comprehend, so I set about purchasing my first &lt;abbr title=&quot;Single Lens Reflex&quot;&gt;SLR&lt;/abbr&gt; to try out photography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had played with cameras in the past and found moments within my point-and-shoot use where I felt genuinely moved by some of the photographs I managed to capture, but I felt limited by the tools and wanted to improve the quality of my work. I took many photos with my 35mm SLR camera but the cost of processing the film frustrated my learning speed, so I was very pleased when I was able to afford a digital camera. While my first digital camera was only 2 megapixels and a point-and-shoot, I grew much in my understanding of laying out a scene and trying different angles because I could immediately see the results of my work on the back of the camera. I quickly grew frustrated by the limitations of the image quality and hoped for a chance to get something better, which eventually came in the form of a much-better digital SLR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way I was able to achieve these goals was by working for one-hour film processors and camera retailers that offered discounts to employees; some of the equipment I still own was purchased during those years. I was a horrible camera sales associate, but I appreciated being able to be around cameras and see the various ways the manufacturers improved the cameras each year. I noticed a continual drop in build quality and features in the low-end point-and-shoot models; combined with my desire to finally purchase a digital SLR, I began to have a heavy disdain for many of the cheap models the general public purchased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I made the right decision to pursue an SLR, but I missed out on the convenience of the point-and-shoot with my continued disdain for those models. With the advantage of time, I was able to look back at some of the better point-and-shoots that I missed, find one used at a terrific price, and get started on taking the random photos I would‚Äôve been disappointed with if taken from my cellphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following photos were taken on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canon-powershot-sx150-is&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Canon PowerShot SX150 IS&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chdk.fandom.com/wiki/CHDK&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CHDK firmware&lt;/a&gt; to enable RAW shooting. In an indictment of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/06/mkbhd-post-processing-ruining-iphone-photos/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;photo quality of my iPhone 13 mini,&lt;/a&gt; this camera takes pictures that I like, even if I have to put more effort into importing them into my Apple Photos collection. While I haven‚Äôt taken the next award-winning photograph with this camera, I have enjoyed being able to have something readily available that doesn‚Äôt look threatening or suspicious and ends up taking a photo I might want to share with someone.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My fun side project</title>
        <author>David Hepworth</author>
        <description>
            &lt;h3 id=&quot;inspired-by-the-2020-apple-event&quot;&gt;Inspired by the 2020 Apple event&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked the aesthetic of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/live/KR0g-1hnQPA?si=AmHCsABjAVYTHXmf&amp;amp;t=3763&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;advertisement for the iPhone 12 Pro that Apple did years ago.&lt;/a&gt; I wanted to remake it in HTML as much as I could, so I used this project to build a list of links to my social network profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I wanted to get the colors of the sunrise from the video, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cssgradient.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;so I went to a tool online,&lt;/a&gt; and uploaded a cropped shot of the sky to grab the colors from it to make a linear-gradient. I tweaked the results and set it up on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make the gradient image appear more filmic, I used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/grainy-gradients/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tool mentioned by CSS-Tricks&lt;/a&gt; to build an SVG file of noise for use as a mask-image in CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then went back to the video and captured a screenshot of the mountain range, tracing over the resulting image in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vectornator.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vectornator.&lt;/a&gt; I customized it to be wider and more varied, experimenting with horizon level, until I exported a final SVG that I then compressed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://imageoptim.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ImageOptim.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, for the stars in the sky I went to NASA and browsed their image gallery until I found an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/the-city-lights-at-the-intersection-of-europe-and-asia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;appropriate photo of stars.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then built the CSS with animations, filters, gradients, mask-images, and shadows to make a glimmering interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check it out at this URL: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dhepworth.github.io/social/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://dhepworth.github.io/social/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Knowledge shouldn‚Äôt be a burden</title>
        <author>David Hepworth</author>
        <description>
            &lt;p&gt;I call myself an introvert &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vipshek.com/blog/interaction&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;but I wonder sometimes if I‚Äôm wrong.&lt;/a&gt; I like to talk a lot, just only about a few things. I deeply enjoy sharing with someone else what I have learned about my favorite subjects. I think learning is a social act, with the reward of learning something being the opportunity to share that new understanding with someone else. What is to be done when some knowledge is seen as a threat? Gaining that sort of knowledge transforms an exhilarating social act into an incredibly effective form of self-isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge seems amoral to me, and learning seems to be as close to a virtue as one could consider. Yet I too, despite my hunger to learn more, can recall with pangs of guilt the council of my youth that considered the act of learning a path riddled with danger, prone to leading a person to destruction if they were not careful. Some things were seen as so antagonistic to a learner that even an idle consideration of such things was a flirtation with the unethical. There was hidden enemy around every paragraph of unapproved text. &lt;a href=&quot;/post/2022/02/03/anxious-about-being-ignorant.html&quot;&gt;I didn‚Äôt want to remain ignorant&lt;/a&gt;, but learning even the smallest new piece of information seems to carry a huge cost to a vast array of elements in my life. Could I find a way to feel comfort in understanding more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am fairly certain that I now know why such a practice of fear of knowledge is fostered in some communities: it is essential to that community‚Äôs continued existence that its adherents avoid the pursuit of individual and unguided learning. To learn for oneself is to seek out truth without a stranger‚Äôs heavy hand guiding one‚Äôs conclusions toward a definitive goal. To understand the complexity of things is to unearth shades of gray instead of the stark contrast of dogma. I could sense that breaking through this programming would be to my benefit, but every step forward felt like a violation. Not everyone wants to take those steps, and that‚Äôs where my isolation begins.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs a happy little song about the world sung by Bo Burnham and his special friend, Socko.
&lt;em&gt;Bo Burnham: Inside&lt;/em&gt; is streaming now on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not a scholar, I‚Äôve done no independent research, and my recall of details is still often dependent on the bookmarks and search results that I‚Äôve saved over the years. I don‚Äôt claim to be a subject matter expert in potentially any area. I am not a better person than someone else because I have read a book. My self-actualization isn‚Äôt the element that will redeem the world or is of much value to someone else. Yet I still really enjoy becoming more educated in an increasing number of the subjects most interesting to me. In some of these subjects I have found vast stretches of information new to me that have thrilled me in their discovery. I have longed for an opportunity to share or discuss this information, but what I have learned is that with each new piece of information, I have inadvertently isolated myself. First, there is a shared language lost in this learning. What seemed obvious and beyond debate to me before now feels open to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/04/AR2006030401369.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;skepticism and consideration,&lt;/a&gt; so I no longer have a solid shared foundation on which to call in conversations. Even agreements on simple definitions have to be made first in order to have a conversation. Secondly, I have found that this knowledge, because of how interesting it is, increases specialization and focus on elements which may not be as interesting or desired by others. This limits my potential conversational opportunities over time, increasing my chances of loneliness. Thirdly, sharing this information triggers the listener with the same anxieties I faced in my youthful culture of fear, making me become an enemy instead of a curious reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that I‚Äôm reading too cold and analytical in this post. I don‚Äôt know how to share more. I think I‚Äôm just coping and trying to survive with what I‚Äôve learned. There are times where I wonder if that phrase ‚Äúignorance is bliss‚Äù may be one of the wisest words ever written. I like knowing so much more about life and the complexities of cultures and governments, but it weighs me down to see how much more pain there is in the world than I realized and how I likely directly contributed to its continuation. I think we could all empathize with each other more by being better educated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did all this knowledge change me for the better or has it ruined me? I feel that I can &lt;a href=&quot;/post/2021/10/26/an-identity-crisis.html&quot;&gt;love so much better and more deeply than before,&lt;/a&gt; but now I feel more lonely when I would have expected to feel closer to community. I am both the same person and yet very different. I &lt;a href=&quot;/post/2022/06/10/feeling-stuck.html&quot;&gt;still see the same world as before&lt;/a&gt; but my definitions have changed and my expectations of &lt;a href=&quot;/post/2021/11/26/we-arent-asking-the-right-questions.html&quot;&gt;what is acceptable have been altered&lt;/a&gt;. My goals of loving others are still there, but the methods aren‚Äôt what they were. Having all this within me keeps me feeling both the best I‚Äôve ever felt and the worst I hope to ever experience. I have fantasized sometimes about having my memory wiped and what that would mean for me, but I don‚Äôt think I could do it. I prize my experiences but I wish I had more people around me with whom to share it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might conclude that I should have accepted the advice from those who warned me not to tread in these spaces, but I believe that the struggle to learn is always the better solution to ignorance, even when it carries a heavy cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Something interesting happens when you realize your generation isn‚Äôt the center of the discourse anymore. I‚Äôm not even talking about being the locus of cool. More like: you just seem to matter less. People are less anxious about you, less mad about you ‚Äî if anything, they seem slightly annoyed by you. You‚Äôre no longer the future. You‚Äôre the well-worn middle.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today we take it for granted that God has no body. But the psalmists had other views. ‚ÄúPraise Yahweh, for he is lovely looking!‚Äù cries one psalmist; another longed to live in the Jerusalem temple all the days of his life, ‚Äúto behold the beauty of Yahweh ‚Ä¶ your face, Yahweh, do I seek.‚Äù&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Being invisible</title>
        <author>David Hepworth</author>
        <description>
            &lt;p&gt;When we moved into our new house, my wife and I decided to purchase a couple seed packs of flowers to put in a garden in the back yard. We chose to purchase native wildflowers; we thought they would have the greatest chance of surviving and the variety of seeds included promised to provide a lot of colors and shapes of blossoms. We were overwhelmed by the assortment when they bloomed in the spring, and marveled at how beautiful and unique each flower was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was potentially even more stunning to us was the classification of ‚Äúweed‚Äù for most of what grew. What we saw as incredibly valuable was deemed by others to be a nuisance, a plant worthy of destruction. We could not fully understand how someone could see such a gorgeous assortment and classify them in such low esteem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realization that value could be so wide in its interpretation was on my mind as I considered my internal image of myself. From my youth I have worked to lessen my consideration of my own value, thinking it a virtue to self-deprecate. I have self-assigned my personal contributions to work assignments and relationships to be of such a minimal worth because I thought it would be prideful to believe or accept any other interpretation. I ignored the compliments of others. I dismissed the evaluations of my worth unless it was at least as bad as my own estimation. I thought I was being a better person by hating myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet as I considered my prized flowers that others would deem repulsive, I wondered if my self-perception could be incorrect. Could I be poisoning my life with such a crushing view of myself? Could I be assigning the status of ‚Äúweed‚Äù to my life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years I have battled the dissonance of wanting to be successful, which would result in some level of notoriety, with the ingrained view that any level of fame is a potential moral failing because being noticed could inevitably lead to pride and destruction of self. I chose invisibility as the default: better to be the wallflower and be a ‚Äúgood person‚Äù than to be popular and turn out a monster. Yet I found no joy in being unknown, for anonymity seemed cursed with an impotence to improve the lives of others. I was no superhero with vast caches of money or super-human abilities to hide my identity while greatly impacting others; instead, I was just hiding in the shadows of my community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How was this misery and near-constant depression anything but a wasted life? I was making little of the changes that I aimed to make as a young adult. I was severely dependent on a few friendships that I constantly chided myself for having and regularly believed to be a case of pity for a slug like me. I was regularly rejecting the value that others assigned to me, inadvertently insulting them by throwing away the compliments they sent to me was a poor judgement of my character. I was being frivolous with the gifts of friendships and community because I thought it better to deprive myself of their joys ‚Äî even guilty for feeling any sense of happiness. What a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now aim to see my life as I see my flowers: they are valuable just by existing, waiting to be seen by others who also see their worth. They will not be treasured by hiding their petals: they must take the risk of being harmed or misrepresented by boldly throwing open their blossoms and calling for the attention of the creatures who will love them. There is no virtue in hiding; there is no absolute moral good in being invisible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The memories I hold closest to me are the ones where people noticed me and loved me. There was a measure of shame associated with enjoying those memories, because I felt that it was wrong to be loved ‚Äî I was, after all, supposed to avoid such feelings lest I fall to pride and vanity. But how can I find value in other humans if the one human I know the most ‚Äî myself ‚Äî I hate with such passion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to see myself, like a flower, as being worthy of love. I know that I am not going to be loved by all, just as a weed may be culled by some and kept by others, but I think that the goal of finding some who see your beauty is worth the pain of being undervalued by others. I think that if I can start seeing myself as valuable and accepting that others can feel the same, I will be far more capable of sharing that same kind of love to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a simple flower can find the courage to be visible, why not I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Old grey-haired waitresses&lt;br /&gt;
In cafes at night&lt;br /&gt;
Have given it up,&lt;br /&gt;
And as i walk down sidewalks of light&lt;br /&gt;
And look into windows of nursing homes&lt;br /&gt;
I can see that it is no longer with them.&lt;br /&gt;
I see people sitting on park benches&lt;br /&gt;
And i can see by the way they sit and look&lt;br /&gt;
That it is gone.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I see people driving cars&lt;br /&gt;
And I see by the way&lt;br /&gt;
They drive their cars&lt;br /&gt;
That they neither love nor are loved ‚Äì&lt;br /&gt;
Nor do they consider sex.&lt;br /&gt;
It is all forgotten&lt;br /&gt;
Like an old movie.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I see people in department stores and supermarkets&lt;br /&gt;
Walking down aisles&lt;br /&gt;
Buying things&lt;br /&gt;
And i can see by the way their clothing&lt;br /&gt;
Fits them and by the way they walk&lt;br /&gt;
And by their faces and their eyes&lt;br /&gt;
That they care for nothing&lt;br /&gt;
And that nothing cares for them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I see a hundred people a day&lt;br /&gt;
Who have given up entirely.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If I go to the racetrack  or a sporting event&lt;br /&gt;
I can see thousands that feel for nothing&lt;br /&gt;
Or no one&lt;br /&gt;
And get no feeling back.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Everywhere I see those who&lt;br /&gt;
Crave nothing but food, shelter, and clothing;&lt;br /&gt;
They concentrate on that,&lt;br /&gt;
Dreamlessly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I do not understand why these people do not&lt;br /&gt;
vanish&lt;br /&gt;
I do not understand why these people do not&lt;br /&gt;
expire&lt;br /&gt;
Why the clouds do not murder them&lt;br /&gt;
Or why the dogs do not murder them&lt;br /&gt;
Or why the flowers and the children do not murder them,&lt;br /&gt;
I do not understand.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I suppose they are murdered&lt;br /&gt;
Yet i can‚Äôt adjust to the&lt;br /&gt;
Fact of them&lt;br /&gt;
Because they are so many.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Each day,&lt;br /&gt;
Each night,&lt;br /&gt;
There are more of them&lt;br /&gt;
In the subways and&lt;br /&gt;
In the buildings and&lt;br /&gt;
In the parks&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;They feel no terror&lt;br /&gt;
At not loving&lt;br /&gt;
Or at not&lt;br /&gt;
Being loved&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;So many many many&lt;br /&gt;
Of my fellow creatures&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here‚Äôs a map out of the wilderness.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Worrying about the state of our men is an American tradition. But today‚Äôs problems are real and well documented.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The culture in which I was raised had specific traits and responsibilities imposed on the sexes. One who strayed too far from those characteristics was threatening one‚Äôs own status as that sex. I was never comfortable adjusting my personality to fit that mold, so I spent years of my life feeling like a nomad among the cultural norms, morally, mentally, and physically failing the expectations of the system. I didn‚Äôt want to follow the traditional expectations of masculinity because many of them remain troubling to me. So much about being a man seemed built as a constrast to the traits of a woman, but handled primarily in an antagonistic and domineering manner that was used as a tool to humiliate and objectify women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeking an alternative to this system has been difficult. I feel conditioned to see differences where none may exist. I still feel anxious that I don‚Äôt have a specific list of unique qualities that would define me as a man, even though I never felt a connection to nor felt any comfort in being limited to such a list. I doubt my value without those characteristics as a tool to define me. It is as if I lack an identity if I can‚Äôt compare myself to a set of qualities that someone else chose for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt think the solution is to seek the answers from someone like Jordan Peterson or Joe Rogan; that seems to be a return to restricting my life to someone else‚Äôs definition of what it is to be a man. I‚Äôm not convinced that any list is actually necessary to my life in the way it once seemed. I think I want to rearrange my list of my identity and place ‚Äúman‚Äù in a mere attribute of me rather than the word under which everything is defined. I think handling it this way will mean I no longer try to consider how a ‚Äúman‚Äù would approach a situation and instead let ‚ÄúDavid‚Äù (that‚Äôs me) get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What is church?</title>
        <author>David Hepworth</author>
        <description>
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does the average American Evangelical attend church? What are their goals, and do they find those goals met?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My history in the Christian church began in my childhood. Most of the sermons I heard came from my father, standing near (but not behind ‚Äî his personal preference) the pulpit of whatever church we were attending at the time. My father pastored several churches throughout my time in the family home, sometimes in church buildings and sometimes in the house of one of the people in attendance. I love my experiences in those years and the communities that formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a bit of an adversarial approach to other churches in the community. I matured in a somewhat sequestered monoculture, often not being exposed to denominations or viewpoints that didn‚Äôt match those of my mentors. As a result, I saw anyone else who disagreed with me as being sadly misinformed to morally degraded, so I kept to my community because I was certain that we were what remained of ‚Äútrue Christians.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I retained this mindset even after leaving the family home and moving across the country to Oklahoma for a job. For about a year I continued to live-stream my father‚Äôs sermons because I was certain that there was no other decent church available, even in the ‚ÄúBible Belt‚Äù of Oklahoma. When I finally felt it was time to build a community of friends in my local community, I visited with deep trepidation my first non-denominational church in my life and the first non-father-led church in years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I had a few prickly moments of uncertainty about the methods of the sermons and the culture of and practices in the church, I discovered that I appreciated learning different views on Bible verses and stories. I began to better understand the differences between denominations and doctrines and why they were a struggle for so many. I met my wife at this time and we both began regularly attending this church with our friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we began attending a small group, where we had our own little Bible study time and then casual conversation around a few snacks. The church didn‚Äôt have a good structure around small groups, so when that small group‚Äôs leaders chose to step away from their roles, the process to reintegrate felt chaotic and mostly hopeless. After finding little success in forming a new group and tiring of the sermons that had begun to feel confined in their scope and study, we moved to a new church farther down the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new church didn‚Äôt have small groups outside of church hours but instead had ‚ÄúSunday School,‚Äù in the sense that the small groups attended either right before or after the sermon on Sunday. This felt like a step backward in terms of building a community, so it was on to the next church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new church had wildly different views on Christian doctrine, so that was a short-lived visit. Besides, it was time to move to Houston for a new job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process continued in Houston. The experiences were the same when we returned to Oklahoma. I shared with my wife my beloved memories of childhood church attendance, but we couldn‚Äôt find a match in culture in any of the churches I attended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was my childhood mentality of the American church being weak being proven true? Had I made a decade-long mistake in choosing to give any one of these churches a chance? Were the only good churches those found in my past? Or was there perhaps a deeper problem of which I was only now becoming aware?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;readmore&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;church-as-a-place-of-learning&quot;&gt;Church as a place of learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have many deeply important memories of the intense Biblical debates I observed or in which I participated during my childhood. My father was often involved in them, and through him I formed much of what I believed to be true about the Bible and the manner in which it should be interpreted. Effectively starting my life as an empty vessel, I filled it with the teaching of my father and those around him, and I heard that teaching spoken often. When I left home I felt confident in my righteousness and certain that what I believed was the most obvious viewpoint one could have and that all good people would share that view. What I discovered in other churches deeply challenged my understanding of the Christian community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other denominations and viewpoints within the Evangelical Christian churches weren‚Äôt based on malicious interpretations as I had expected. People weren‚Äôt actively rebelling against my view of the Bible as I had declared in my past. Every church member was behaving in a way that they thought was proper and striving to meet the standards that they believed were set for them through the text of the Bible and the church culture that they preferred. Denominational differences were based on reasoning that appeared sound for both sides. My understanding of the Bible was just one of many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the diversity of opinion was exciting, it got me wondering: if all these groups read the same text but came to different and equally confident conclusions, then how could I really claim to be certain that what I believed was the best interpretation? I didn‚Äôt know these viewpoints existed until I started visiting these churches and I had only seen a small selection, but one of them had to be true, right? It seemed mathematically conclusive that at least one of the churches in existence had the fully proper interpretation of the Bible. Was one of those churches in my proximity, or were all the churches around me teaching at least one falsehood?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/960863-until-every-soul-is-freely-permitted-to-investigate-every-book&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is amazing to me that a difference of opinion upon subjects that we know nothing with certainty about, should make us hate, persecute, and despise each other. Why a difference of opinion upon predestination, or the trinity, should make people imprison and burn each other seems beyond the comprehension of man; and yet in all countries where Christians have existed, they have destroyed each other to the exact extent of their power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Robert G. Ingersoll ‚Äî &lt;em&gt;Mistakes of Moses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A multitude of questions started to flow through my mind, overwhelming me and leading to great distress. What were the pastors not telling me? Was a pastor from a seminary a more reliable or a more biased source? Was a confident pastor an ignorant one or a learned one? If I was visiting churches looking for one that seemed ‚Äúright‚Äù to me, was I really looking to learn or just confirm my own presuppositions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major moment of change for me was when I learned of the long-fought debate between people who based their faith on free will versus those who believed in determinism. My early interactions in this area were watching debates on YouTube between James White and Leighton Flowers, who passionately and regularly sniped back and forth about the exclusively correct state of their opposing interpretations of the Bible. Mr. White tended to boast of the ancestral credentials to his viewpoint, following the lineage of the view back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/06/19/how-st-augustine-invented-sex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aurelius Augustinus,&lt;/a&gt; an angst-ridden man who tortured himself with worries about his moral state with God, and Mr. Flowers‚Äô &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Potters-Promise-Biblical-Traditional-Soteriology/dp/0692561846&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;viewpoint&lt;/a&gt; which focused more on how God couldn‚Äôt be a loving god while also purposely creating people intended to be doomed to eternal punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was alarming to me in watching and reading their reasoning was discovering that &lt;em&gt;they were both correct&lt;/em&gt;. They had very good points on which to base their views and verse after verse to support them. The whole reason the debate had continued for so long was because the writers in the Bible &lt;em&gt;also had differing views&lt;/em&gt;. The disagreements between the founders of Christianity are documented within the Bible, never mind the centuries of councils and denominations that formed based on those differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misquoting_Jesus&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, a number of passages in our surviving manuscripts appear to embody the apologetic concerns of the early Christians, especially as these relate to the founder of their faith, Jesus himself. Just as with theological conflicts in the early church, the question of the role of women, and the controversies with the Jews, so too with the disputes raging between Christians and their cultured despisers among the pagans: all of these controversies came to affect the texts that were eventually to become part of the book that we now call the New Testament, as this book‚Äîor rather, this set of books‚Äîwas compiled by nonprofessional scribes in the second and third centuries, and occasionally came to be altered in light of the contexts of their day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Bart D. Ehrman ‚Äî &lt;em&gt;Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn‚Äôt find the answers to my questions in any of the churches I attended; instead, I only witnessed apologetics for one position or the other, argued in a vacuum with the opposition as a boogeyman. Every verse was bent and twisted to fit one harmonious view, only to be distorted in the opposite way to fit the contrasting view in the church across the street. One &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/texas-pastor-says-gay-people-shot-back-head-shocking-sermon-rcna32748&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;church could be lead by a pastor wishing to kill gay people&lt;/a&gt; while another &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandan_Robertson&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;church could be employing a gay pastor.&lt;/a&gt; Some pastors might advocate for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://southsidechurchofchrist.com/sermons/hellfire-and-brimstone.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;eternal torture of sinners&lt;/a&gt; for their finite faults committed during their life; some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/11/26/the-hell-raiser-3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;that there is no Hell;&lt;/a&gt; others might claim that &lt;a href=&quot;https://reknew.org/2008/01/the-case-for-annihilationism/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hell is misunderstood;&lt;/a&gt; some might attest that the issue is moot because everyone &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOzmwGmiDHQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;can&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universalist_Church_of_America&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;will&lt;/a&gt; eventually go to Heaven. Each view would claim divine authority and would have enough Biblical support to be convincing to &lt;em&gt;those seeking that particular viewpoint&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began to understand that if I were to stay within just the learning experience of a church sermon, I would have to accept that the source of my understanding of the Bible would likely largely stay within myself. I was like every other church member: unconsciously forming the interpretation of the Bible based on a personal worldview and then seeking out a church that would confirm that view through selective reading of Bible passages. That is a comforting state to many and one that I experienced for many years of my life, but I wanted to understand more. I was worried that I wasn‚Äôt going to find a reliable informational source within the walls of a church. I sought out wider opinions from scholars, historians, and philosophers who had a greater amount of experience in not only the matters of the Bible but the context in which it was written and the societies around it during its formation. I wanted a more scientific method of discovery where opinions could be tested in a more public forum. Once I realized that there was so much more to learn about the Bible than what one denomination or another could offer or allow, and that deeper thought was actually rather widely available, I knew that a church would likely never again be a place of learning for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;church-as-a-community-center&quot;&gt;Church as a community center&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When moving to a new neighborhood where no friends or family live, one might ask a local how they found and formed their own friendships. In Oklahoma, the primary response one should expect is to attend a church. Church is often where people claim to have met some of their deepest and most meaningful connections. In my experience, many people might be saying it, but few are living it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A church sermon isn‚Äôt really the place for one to have a conversation with even the person in the next seat, so church leaders came up with the solution: church, but smaller, in the form of meetings with a limited selection of church members who share common interests or stages of life. Nearly every church I‚Äôve visited has encouraged the assembly of smaller groups of church members to meet within the church building on Sunday or within each other‚Äôs homes during the week. Usually the suggestion is to attend all options provided: a community group and a sermon on Sunday morning and a small group at some point during the week. These groups usually convene in the form of a ‚ÄúBible study,‚Äù where a group leader reads the Bible and then pilots discussion afterwards. Sometimes the studies involve the same book as what is being discussed in the sermon on Sunday morning, and sometimes the sermon itself is the focus of discussion. The purpose of these groups is to build friendships with a selection of church members and to keep the Bible as a priority throughout the week. Pastors will often say that the sermon may be a place where someone gets to learn about the faith, but that the effects of that sermon and the community to support the changes that it produces are found within a community group and small group. One pastor I heard went so far as to say that very little value could be produced from exclusively attending church on Sunday morning; community groups were that essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of these community groups is to build deep friendships with the others who attend, share painful moments from the week with them, and then receive or give encouragement. But these aren‚Äôt friends, they‚Äôre strangers. Meeting for an hour or two a week &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0265407518761225&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;will not produce friendships.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0265407518761225&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casual friendships emerge around 30 hr, followed by friendships around 50 hr. Good friendships begin to emerge after 140 hr. Best friendships do not emerge until after 300 hr of time spent. Whether spending 30 or 600 hr of time together, the percentage of all relationships formed in closed systems (e.g., work, school) remains relatively constant. Logistic regressions offered 3-point estimates: 94 hr when acquaintances become casual friends, 164 hr when casual friends become friends, and 219 hr when friends become good/best friends. These numbers are likely conservative estimates due to the inclusion of both closed system and chosen relationships and due to the retrospective nature of the study. It is quite likely that the friendship status transitioned to a higher level before these cut-point estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jeffrey A. Hall ‚Äî &lt;em&gt;How many hours does it take to make a friend?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the community groups that tend to succeed don‚Äôt prosper because the members met &lt;em&gt;in the community group&lt;/em&gt;, they prosper because the people attending met and became good friends &lt;em&gt;before forming their own community group&lt;/em&gt;. The community group doesn‚Äôt appear to regularly be the catalyst for the formation of a community, but rather the byproduct of one built elsewhere. This pre-existing friendship makes it incredibly hard for new community group members to break through, either requiring a separate clique of new members becoming acquaintances or forever feeling like an outsider among the community. If there isn‚Äôt enough growth within the community ‚Äî and due to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/19/opinion/religion-america.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;decreasing numbers of churchgoers,&lt;/a&gt; that is often the case ‚Äî then the general expectation I have for community groups is the slow withering of new members who quietly leave and never return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Church isn‚Äôt the place to build community, but it‚Äôs often cited as such. What options are available to those who no longer see church in that way and who seek an alternative? The choices seem limited, in part because enough churchgoers see church as the ultimate source of community, rejecting many other legitimate and perhaps superior methods available to them even if their preferred meeting choice of a church isn‚Äôt leading to a thriving base of friendships. For some, leaving that hub to instead experience long periods of loneliness and uncertainty is too painful; but for others like me, staying within a broken system is even worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;church-as-a-cultural-example&quot;&gt;Church as a cultural example&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10426666-in-the-end-doug-wilson-john-piper-mark-driscoll-james&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, Doug Wilson, John Piper, Mark Driscoll, James Dobson, Doug Phillips, and John Eldredge all preached a mutually reinforcing vision of Christian masculinity‚Äîof patriarchy and submission, sex and power. It was a vision that promised protection for women but left women without defense, one that worshiped power and turned a blind eye to justice, and one that transformed the Jesus of the Gospels into an image of their own making. Though rooted in different traditions and couched in different styles, their messages blended together to become the dominant chord in the cacophony of evangelical popular culture. And they had been right all along. The militant Christian masculinity they practiced and preached did indelibly shape both family and nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Kristin Kobes DuMez ‚Äî &lt;em&gt;Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up I heard Christians say that churches make up (or should make up) for the social services that are lacking from state and federal government, so that charitable giving to churches was a net good as that money was then sent out into the community. &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/conservative-myth-social-safety-net-120000203.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;That belief may not be fully grounded in reality,&lt;/a&gt; but it is a useful example for the point that I‚Äôm trying to make. Churches are often depicted, at least in the areas where I‚Äôve lived, as a moral example to the rest of the world. Real love, guidance, companionship, and mentoring can be found only in a church, or so the claims go. I used to believe there may be some credence to these claims, but I find them pretty dubious now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Churches claim moral supremacy, but they regularly prove themselves to be incredibly dangerous outlets for repressed emotions. Despite the origin of Christianity being founded within the oppressed and weak, modern churches share a legacy and continued reputation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/religious-right-real-origins-107133/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bigotry and hatred of minorities.&lt;/a&gt; Pastors regularly advocate for a political party that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republicans-voting-against-their-own-interests-its_b_596cec66e4b07f87578e6ab7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;actively harms its constituents&lt;/a&gt; with a leader who &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump#Misogyny_and_allegations_of_sexual_misconduct&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;flagrantly violates the lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; that Christians deem acceptable to their god. Church leaders &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/illinois-catholic-church-child-abuse-rcna86289&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;regularly commit sexual assault&lt;/a&gt; against their followers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2022/06/02/1102621352/how-the-southern-baptist-convention-covered-up-its-widespread-sexual-abuse-scand&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;infrastructure exists to keep it hidden.&lt;/a&gt; Some pastors can‚Äôt manage to say the phrase &lt;a href=&quot;https://whatwouldyousay.org/should-christians-support-black-lives-matter/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; without at least a caveat. During Covid-19, churches were sources of misinformation and anti-science sentiment, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/united-house-of-prayer-for-all-people-in-charlotte-north-carolina-spread-coronavirus-locals-say&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;leading to numerous deaths from super-spreader events.&lt;/a&gt; Churches offer mentoring, but not the variety that is based on science intended to aid those in need, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportskeeda.com/pop-culture/epic-cult-vibes-james-river-church-tank-video-goes-viral-leaves-internet-disbelief&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;unless one is to believe that monster trucks teach men how to be decent humans.&lt;/a&gt; One churchgoer was so frustrated by the lack of good leadership for men in his church that &lt;a href=&quot;https://truemanlifecoaching.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he started his own non-profit&lt;/a&gt; to assist men who felt they didn‚Äôt get proper leadership from their churches. These are training tools &lt;em&gt;for men&lt;/em&gt;, by far the most favored sex in the patriarchal complementarian view most churches prefer. Women instead receive the special treatment of an extra dose of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.choosingtherapy.com/purity-culture/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;purity culture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/southern-baptist-convention-sex-abuse.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;victim blaming.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10899605-ironically-complementarian-theology-claims-it-is-defending-a-plain-and&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, complementarian theology claims it is defending a plain and natural interpretation of the Bible while really defending an interpretation that has been corrupted by our sinful human drive to dominate others and build hierarchies of power and oppression. I can‚Äôt think of anything less Christlike than hierarchies like these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Beth Allison Barr ‚Äî &lt;em&gt;The Making of Biblical Womanhood: How the Subjugation of Women Became Gospel Truth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over and over and &lt;em&gt;over and &lt;strong&gt;over&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; again churches do not behave in the way that they say they do. Some will admit to this hypocrisy, but refer to their poor behavior as ‚Äútheir mess,‚Äù a euphemism for the same type of behavior for which others outside the church are condemned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I certainly understand why people within the churches feel that they have the best of everything within their culture, but it‚Äôs because they‚Äôve been conditioned to never step outside of that bubble. They‚Äôve been trained to believe that their neighbor is ‚Äúthe enemy‚Äù if they don‚Äôt follow the church‚Äôs exact blend of philosophical or doctrinal standards. They‚Äôve been indoctrinated to never seek answers outside of a certain circle of speakers, even though there is an abundance of scholarship available for free to anyone with a library card or an internet connection. Christians have been told to live in constant fear by the very people helping to engender that anxiety, and to give their money and their bodies to the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-church&quot;&gt;What is church?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be able to honestly answer the question I raised in the title of this post, but I know I‚Äôm terribly biased these days against the church. I didn‚Äôt find that it followed through on its promises and I don‚Äôt like feeling lied to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-no-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;flex-item&quot; style=&quot;aspect-ratio: 16/9&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/A2ttSv7I9HY&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Churches are spaces where one man may share his worldview in a position of authority and use an ancient collection of texts to support that position. If enough people like hearing their own worldview confidently repeated back to them, then the pastor becomes popular and the viewpoint becomes the more accepted position for moderate Christians. The text of the Bible contains sections of letters that share this tension amongst its followers, even in its early stages of formation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%204:3-4&amp;amp;version=NASB&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the time will come when they will not tolerate sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance with their own desires, and they will turn their ears away from the truth and will turn aside to myths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Timothy 4:3 (New American Standard Version)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or in this passage, where Paul, who repeatedly made the claim that his particular viewpoint was directly inspired by God and therefore the only complete and accurate viewpoint, makes this observation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+1%3A10-12&amp;amp;version=NASB&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I urge you, brothers and sisters, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment. For I have been informed concerning you, my brothers and sisters, by Chloe‚Äôs people, that there are quarrels among you. Now I mean this, that each one of you is saying, ‚ÄúI am with Paul,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am with Apollos,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am with Cephas,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am with Christ.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Corinthians 1:10‚Äì12 (New American Standard Version)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pauline view of Christianity prevailed through centuries of debate, inspiring later followers like Augustine and Martin Luther to further expand upon his foundations and build a devoted following throughout the centuries. Other viewpoints, existing within the Bible and throughout history, have fought and lost the battle for public acceptance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcion_of_Sinope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;branded as heretical.&lt;/a&gt; That this opinion was swayed by the current events of the time is rarely accepted among Christian churches, who advocate for divine inspiration throughout generations as the reasoning for the evolving standards of the faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Churches could be a forum for discussion on how to adapt the faith to the era in which is it currently being spoken, or a safe area to discuss the Bible and the complexities of its interpretations without judgement, but it is instead a machine for dogmatic thought and unquestioning application. Questioning is doubt, and doubt that doesn‚Äôt lead to a result that the church favors is ultimately a sin, so people choose to be told what to think rather than risk being seen as a sinner. Learning about the Bible‚Äôs history outside of the walls of a church has been far more interesting to me because I‚Äôve been able to explore all lines of thought without judgement by a pastor or community group. The result is that I have been able to understand far more about the Bible, its history, and the impact it has had on the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/960965-let-us-forget-that-we-are-baptists-methodists-catholics-presbyterians&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us forget that we are Baptists, Methodists, Catholics, Presbyterians, or Free-thinkers, and remember only that we are men and women. After all, man and woman are the highest possible titles. All other names belittle us, and show that we have, to a certain extent, given up our individuality, and have consented to wear the collar of authority‚Äîthat we are followers. Throwing away these names, let us examine these questions not as partisans, but as human beings with hopes and fears in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Robert G. Ingersoll ‚Äî &lt;em&gt;Mistakes of Moses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I can answer what church is by advocating for what it shouldn‚Äôt be: a hurdle to being a decent human being. As soon as a pastor or a denomination starts setting rules in place that seem to be getting in the way of being loving to others or asking difficult questions with uncomfortable answers, I believe that it‚Äôs in everyone‚Äôs best interest to choose something different to do on a Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is Christian fundamentalism and when did Christians start teaching fundamentalism? The movement of Fundamentalism comes during struggles between faith and science, as the teachings of Darwin and others began to concern Christians as it appeared to undermine their understanding of the Bible. This video tells the story of the Scopes Monkey Trial, the publishing of The Christian Fundamentals, and the ensuing culture war between certain Christians and intellectual culture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the modern world we‚Äôre very comfortable with the Conservative versus Liberal splits that are part and parcel of the church, not only in the West but around the globe. We use words like ‚Äúfundamentalist,‚Äù ‚Äúprogressive,‚Äù ‚Äúliberal,‚Äù and a host of others as a way of signaling the split. But, I can say as a teacher of history, the more I look around the world today the more I realize that people tend to believe or they maybe assume that many of these splits are a product of the 20th century, or maybe they go back a good bit before that to the early enlightenment itself. Well, of either of those two extremes the history is not on their side.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Hopelessness in video games</title>
        <author>David Hepworth</author>
        <description>
            &lt;p&gt;I used to play a lot of video games. These days I settle for some games from my Apple Arcade subscription, but I used to have many mobile consoles, several home consoles, and a gaming PC. I played many titles across a variety of platforms, filling out a list of memorable games that left a permanent impact on my life. In a recent conversation with my coworkers I started listing my favorite games and learned that the games that I have felt the most important in my life were ones that generated a feeling of hopelessness. I certainly enjoy a variety of gaming genres and story types, but the ones I can recall with fondness are the ones that made me feel the most miserable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these being my favorite games across all consoles, these are not generally the games that I return to in the brief moments where I can find time to play a game. Even when I played games regularly, I rarely replayed any of these games. In many cases I only felt that I could play them once, as going back to them would lessen the original experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shadow-of-the-colossus&quot;&gt;Shadow of the Colossus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-no-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;flex-item&quot; style=&quot;aspect-ratio: 16/9&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pdZQ98mWeto&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a child I was an avid reader. I read &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; at a young age, and while I didn‚Äôt care much for the meandering nature of the books, I appreciated the world-building and the grounded drama that ran throughout. I later became a regular movie-watcher, where I enjoyed &lt;em&gt;The Never Ending Story&lt;/em&gt;‚Äôs grim tale about depression and fighting back against a world that wants nothing but to oppress and destroy young spirits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd never experienced a game that got anywhere close to a similar experience until &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Colossus&lt;/em&gt;, the best game that I‚Äôve ever witnessed. I was chilled by the loneliness of the environments; awed by the technological capabilities of the coders building for a weak PlayStation 2 architecture; moved by the love driving the character to sacrifice so much for the princess; and driven to tears by the loss experienced by every character in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way that the weak gaming hardware was used as a plot device continues to impress me. The game world was barren because the console couldn‚Äôt handle anything more, but the plot provided a reason that made the minimal level design feel more acceptable: a dangerous creature was cut off from civilization to keep it chained and hidden. The game world was large and required horseback riding long distances because it was streaming from the disk and loading took a while, but the level design made it feel like a reasonable journey to a remote location that proved the commitment of the character. Having only one enemy at a time helped keep the already-struggling framerate stay at least somewhat playable most of the time, but making the enemies huge really fed into the fantasy story more than if they were merely a few feet taller than the main character. So much of this game was brilliantly executed, to the point that I have little interest in playing the remakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spec-ops-the-line&quot;&gt;Spec Ops: The Line&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-no-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;flex-item&quot; style=&quot;aspect-ratio: 16/9&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wD661k1UpvQ&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt; may get all the accolades for its plot twist, but I think &lt;em&gt;Spec Ops: The Line&lt;/em&gt; handles it twists in a more elegant and less frustrating manner. The concept of mental illness comes up often in games, but it tends to be used more as a gaming mechanic than primarily an element of the plot. I think that &lt;em&gt;Spec Ops: The Line&lt;/em&gt; tends to actually focus more on the plot, with some weaker gameplay and average graphics as a potential consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot is what makes it so much more interesting than &lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt;, even though the latter has more inventive fighting, better voice acting across the cast, and better visual quality. Both games feature forced choices that punish the player for performing them, even though neither have alternatives built into the game, but &lt;em&gt;Spec Ops: The Line&lt;/em&gt; has both an omniscient narrator and side characters who cast doubt on the situation to serve as a proxy for the player, whereas &lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt; leaves much of that out of the game in the service of its plot twist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I especially appreciate the end of &lt;em&gt;Spec Ops: The Line&lt;/em&gt;, which provides one final choice that has chilling ramifications should one choose one of the options. It is a moment of very limited role-playing, but I appreciate its inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game certainly has a lot of flaws and felt constrained by its budget, but the ambitions of the writer seemed to overpower much of the game‚Äôs limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;homeworld&quot;&gt;Homeworld&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-no-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;flex-item&quot; style=&quot;aspect-ratio: 16/9&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pA7FbYAmrX0&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game is unique on the list in that it depicts the actual destruction of the civilization rather than a retrospective of a long-dead culture. I was deeply moved by the experience of watching a nation fall and its survivors escape into the darkness, and it made every character death thereafter more painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot definitely contains a thread of hope throughout it, but it‚Äôs weighed by the tragic loss at the start of the story, leavening everything with desperation and fear of an unknown enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;uru-ages-beyond-myst&quot;&gt;Uru: Ages Beyond Myst&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-no-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;flex-item&quot; style=&quot;aspect-ratio: 4/3&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Ncw3t69Ze4&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn‚Äôt play much of the &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; series before &lt;em&gt;Uru: Ages Beyond Myst&lt;/em&gt;, but we often as a family watched my father play the game to help come up with solutions for the complicated puzzles. I was fascinated by the world of &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; more than I was the puzzles, and I thought &lt;em&gt;Uru: Ages Beyond Myst&lt;/em&gt; did a better job of building a world than any of the previous games. Better still are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mystjourney.com/riven/myst-novels/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;novelizations of the &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt; universe&lt;/a&gt;. An abandoned world from a dead civilization is always deeply interesting to me. I always wanted to know more about what caused the culture to collapse and the cities to empty, and &lt;em&gt;Uru&lt;/em&gt; helped explain a little more of that than the other games in the series. I especially liked the added realism of a three-dimensional game over the slideshows of some of the previous games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iron-helix&quot;&gt;Iron Helix&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-no-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;flex-item&quot; style=&quot;aspect-ratio: 16/9&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pDULUgKSVUw&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To continue on the ‚Äúabandoned world by a dead civilization‚Äù theme, &lt;em&gt;Iron Helix&lt;/em&gt; was one of the first games that I played that had me solving puzzles related to the death of a crew on a spaceship protected by a drone that was going to attack any presence it detected. I liked finding the solution, but what intrigued me more was the logs of the crew uncovering some of the problems going on around the ship. I felt like I was involved in a world rather than solving a series of riddles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bastion--transistor&quot;&gt;Bastion / Transistor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-no-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;flex-item&quot; style=&quot;aspect-ratio: 16/9&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mX48y24t9iU&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;flex-item&quot; style=&quot;aspect-ratio: 16/9&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RT55lch6y_U&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grouped these two games together because they almost feel like they come from a shared universe, but that‚Äôs probably more due to them sharing so many talented crew and cast between them, as they came from the same developer, one soon after the other. My preference is for &lt;em&gt;Bastion&lt;/em&gt;, as I think it had the more fulfilling plot of the two, but I do really appreciate the dying worlds of both. There is a mourning for what is lost in &lt;em&gt;Transistor&lt;/em&gt; that is missing somewhat in &lt;em&gt;Bastion&lt;/em&gt;, primarily because &lt;em&gt;Bastion&lt;/em&gt;‚Äôs world is so stylized that it doesn‚Äôt correlate well with reality; however, &lt;em&gt;Bastion&lt;/em&gt; has the more compelling resolution to its plot, in my opinion. I think I liked &lt;em&gt;Transistor&lt;/em&gt; more for the way the world was written out, the shadows of what once was being referenced in odd corners of the levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;halo-3-odst&quot;&gt;Halo 3: ODST&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-no-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;flex-item&quot; style=&quot;aspect-ratio: 16/9&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WroxHMo6B_k&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one may seem like an odd addition to the list, but I was surprised by the loneliness and despair of this noir-like game. The audio vignettes from the other characters were quite a contrast from the destroyed city abandoned by its fleeing population, desperately seeking safety from an invading army. Being a secondary character to a much bigger story helped the war feel more comprehensive and somewhat distant, perhaps even unredeemable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anarchy-online&quot;&gt;Anarchy Online&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-no-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;flex-item&quot; style=&quot;aspect-ratio: 16/9&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MTQaTI4pQSk&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played &lt;em&gt;Anarchy Online&lt;/em&gt; when they switched to a free-to-play model for players who were interested in playing the levels that had been left empty by players who had moved on to newer and costly expansions. The game felt like a dead mall as a result of this separation. I walked the wide and barren streets of many sections of the free levels, noticing different areas where the level designers had expected crowds to form, and wondered what the city must have been like back when it was attractive to visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;journey--sky-children-of-the-light&quot;&gt;Journey / Sky: Children of the Light&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-no-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;flex-item&quot; style=&quot;aspect-ratio: 16/9&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mU3nNT4rcFg&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;flex-item&quot; style=&quot;aspect-ratio: 16/9&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/A3DNTfhUy0k&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story for these two games are extremely similar: a long-dead city is visited by a quiet explorer, who finds token of the people who once lived there; after some time, tragedy occurs and the explorer follows the people to a new life. &lt;em&gt;Journey&lt;/em&gt; aims for a single, simple story on that shared premises, and it concludes without answering much of the questions raised by the lore. &lt;em&gt;Sky: Children of the Light&lt;/em&gt; continues with that theme and adds more backstory to some success, though I find the level design ultimately more fulfilling than the developer‚Äôs attempts at building a cohesive world. Either way, there is something very poignant about the warm loneliness that the games elicit from me during my various visits to their worlds. Whenever I play them I long for more explanation for what was lost in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dear-esther--everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture&quot;&gt;Dear Esther / Everybody‚Äôs Gone to the Rapture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-no-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;flex-item&quot; style=&quot;aspect-ratio: 16/9&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_pWBV6UTEyg&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;flex-item&quot; style=&quot;aspect-ratio: 16/9&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/w1tBl7upgDU&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading or hearing the stories of long-dead characters is apparently pretty captivating to me, because both of these games continue to haunt me years after seeing them. Especially captivating is the potentially repetitious pattern of existence subtly referenced in &lt;em&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/em&gt;, where characters seem to inhabit the same patterns of life throughout history, unknowingly repeating the mistakes of previous generations and ending up at the same island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience with &lt;em&gt;Everybody‚Äôs Gone to the Rapture&lt;/em&gt; is more limited as I‚Äôve only watched the gameplay through videos, but it follows a similar theme of observing someone else‚Äôs loss while also processing one‚Äôs own in a way. It feels more like a radio play than &lt;em&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/em&gt;, but it‚Äôs still captivating to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching someone else play wasn‚Äôt unique to &lt;em&gt;Everybody‚Äôs Gone to the Rapture&lt;/em&gt;: as I have grown older, I have had less time to play any games of substance and have turned to Twitch and YouTube videos to keep up with the community that provided so much to me in my youth. The following games were consumed entirely through videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scorn&quot;&gt;Scorn&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-no-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;flex-item&quot; style=&quot;aspect-ratio: 16/9&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/i9eg7Pzk15g&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the H.R. Giger / Zdzis≈Çaw Beksi≈Ñski designs and fascination with the viscera of every creature in the game is taken to an uncomfortable extreme, but the depth of detail in building a ruined world is incredible and the skill in level and creature design is superb. I am repulsed by this game as much as I am in awe of it, so I tend to have to push aside all the awful elements to better appreciate the desolation depicted throughout the game. The sadness of the main character and the efforts to find resolution is an element that remains a thorn in my mind, months after watching the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;death-stranding&quot;&gt;DEATH STRANDING&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-no-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;flex-item&quot; style=&quot;aspect-ratio: 16/9&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XcuFJXgU6cA&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can thank Hideo Kojima for introducing me to Low Roar, a singer perfect for a sad and rainy drive. I suppose the theme of the game is more about building hope among a community than showcasing a lack of hope, but the world is deeply damaged, perhaps irrevocably, with only one man able to start threading things back together. I think the struggle to find purpose in a ruined world is one filled with despair, and many areas of the game felt deeply lonely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soma&quot;&gt;SOMA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-no-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;flex-item&quot; style=&quot;aspect-ratio: 16/9&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rf4pAsNy_vA&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a sad end to a world: to know the surface is burning and the survivors deep within the earth are dwindling and often seeking an end to it all. To struggle with one‚Äôs identity at the same time is deeply discouraging. I thought the horror elements of this game certainly provided opportunities to ponder what it was like to exist as one of those creatures, but I don‚Äôt think they added much to the gameplay. I wanted to know more about what the final moments on the surface were like, with more information about what caused all the fateful events to occur. I wanted to know what the general population thought when things &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwXseZSjLsw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;all started to burn.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;returnal&quot;&gt;Returnal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-no-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;flex-item&quot; style=&quot;aspect-ratio: 16/9&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jv4BjWoB-NA&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt think I felt the full weight of hopelessness in this game until I contemplated what escaping the planet and living out as close to a normal life could mean, if death always meant a return to the planet. How horrible a fate that even death was no escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;i-do-smile-from-time-to-time&quot;&gt;I do smile from time to time&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose my fascination with the end of things and the reasons for everything failing might seem like I am a miserable person to be around, but I don‚Äôt welcome oblivion; I much prefer to live in a society that is growing or thriving than I am to live in one near its end. As much as I have enjoyed playing games with post-apocalyptic themes, I don‚Äôt relish the thought of these events ever occurring in reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I have learned from these games ‚Äî and this may seem like an odd lesson, but I do think there is a connection ‚Äî is that hope requires effort. Without striving for improvement, we all slide towards annihilation. Submitting to hopelessness will ruin us all, even if the villains or predicaments in our lives &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; unbeatable. I think that is why I often pay attention to local and national politics, as I am worried for the future of the country and for all the people who live in it, even those who don‚Äôt act or look like me. These games have shown me that hopelessness is easy; it‚Äôs the default position of any person who has given up their agency and accepted the abyss. True heroism comes from finding hope within that chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven‚Äôt registered to vote, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://turbovote.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;do so today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The time for analog clocks is over</title>
        <author>David Hepworth</author>
        <description>
            &lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt like analog clocks. People have tried to persuade me and have shown me the obvious benefits to using such a platform, but I continue to remain unconvinced and I feel that I have good reason for my opinion. I will now present a rather adversarial and controversial view of why analog clocks are inferior to the newer digital clock method of presenting time. This will be a pedantic and antagonistic position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am part of a shameful selection of adults who find little value in the modern-day use of the analog clock. I never set it as a goal to find myself in opposition to the existence of the analog clock, but I have to accept now that my continued confusion is likely permanent. I realize that by being in such a slim minority of people in the world that I will likely not find a sympathetic ear, but this will not silence me. I will not self-censor just because such a huge amount of people find no issue with what troubles me. This is the internet, the year 2023, and I am an American white male who has considered making his own podcast. Everything is permitted for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the appeal of selecting a tool less efficient for the job? Some people like the performative or meditative aspects of many hobbies and tasks, making a point of the time spent on the task compared to its comparatively mindless modern automated method. But for the average user, is the use of an analog clock rooted in art or contemplation, or is it rather on average to find out the time of day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my issue is rooted in the way that I perceive the purpose and working of the analog clock. The average analog clock displays the hours and minutes using two hands, one for each element of time. When one wishes to look at the time on the analog clock, it is performed by looking at both hands and perceiving their proximity to a number or dash running along the edge of the clock‚Äôs surface. Both hands must be seen to accurately understand the current time, and the passage of time dynamically changes the position of those information-giving hands throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, a digital clock presents the time in a left-to-right hour:minute pattern that does not change in position, requires no guessing or deciphering of what combination of number/letter/dash refers to the hours and minutes on the face of the clock, and can be shrunk to sizes smaller than an analog clock without obfuscating the detail it is attempting to present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually look at an analog clock in an hour:minute method, which may be my first mistake. I expect to see an hour hand pointing to the current hour, rather than giving me a semi-accurate approximation of the time distance between the current hour and the next. If the time is 7:55, I struggle knowing if the hand is pointing toward the seven or the eight. I then look at the minute hand, which is actually pointing directly at its intended digit instead of being somewhere vague. I usually read that analog clock, then, as ‚Äú8:55 ‚Äî¬†wait no, uh, 7:55? Yes, 7:55.‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why make an hour hand perform the task of both the hour and minute hand and then include a minute hand whose task is solely to display minutes? Why not have an analog clock that displays one hand over the current actual hour and then have a minute hand point to the current minute? The hour hand is the only hand on the clock, even including the second hand, that doesn‚Äôt point to its intended target aside from maybe five minutes in an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn‚Äôt make sense to cling to this archaic and inefficient method of timekeeping any longer. Please join me in advocating for this silly aspect of one‚Äôs life and becoming a tyrant like I have, externalizing my own weaknesses by moaning about other people‚Äôs choices.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Flooding and school shootings</title>
        <author>David Hepworth</author>
        <description>
            &lt;p&gt;The fragility of life is rarely more realized than in the moments surrounding a natural disaster. In the normalcy of daily routines, we all can fall numb to the potential dangers present in our world. To stay vigilant would be exhausting, so we avoid considering them until the signs of something terrible approaching are too obvious to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people handle the burden of watching by making it their occupation. They look for the signs and share it with the rest of the population, hoping to avert disaster. The general public then takes those findings into consideration and changes or adapts to handle the oncoming issue. This has helped humanity overcome hardship and avert disaster throughout its more recent history, sparing the lives of millions and allowing for greater progress and stability in many countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember hearing the criticism of Houston‚Äôs city planning when the hurricane flooded many city streets: how the draining system was not prepared, how the homes were not built at an appropriate height from the street, and how the systems to mitigate flooding weren‚Äôt maintained well in advance of the storm. In the aftermath, people expected efforts to be made to prevent future disaster. Homes were built taller and flood plains were given better consideration. There was a measure of learned helplessness in the reaction, though: too much of the city infrastructure was already built to change it to adapt to the new information and experience gained from the flooding. Only a limited reaction could be produced as a response to the flooding, but those actions were taken. It wasn‚Äôt a question; people wanted to never let this happen again, but their options were restricted because of the cost to change the existing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now consider the way that we react countrywide to school shootings. Little is set in stone ‚Äî or concrete, if one were to compare the laws and systems around gun use in the United States to the infrastructure of Houston. We can adapt to new information and new experiences and learn from them to make a better system for our children. Yet in each instance, we instead react as if there are fewer options available to us than what Houstonians were presented. Incredibly, many actually suggest adding additional guns into the situation, as if adding more water to a flood would help prevent flooding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New technology and methods are regularly introduced to communities to better handle future weather and flooding events, to forecast the danger, and how to respond to it. Gun safety, on the contrary, seems to be a completely preventable man-made issue. Clear signs of its dangerous elements are evident through existing data and methods to prevent it are already in law around the world. What is it about so many of our political leaders that they would seek to cause harm to their constituents, and why do those constituents ignore their contradictory behavior? Is it not in their best interest to look to the helpers, hear their cries, and adapt to avoid the danger? Isn‚Äôt living enough of a danger in itself? Why add to our problems by encouraging further harm to us and our children?&lt;/p&gt;
