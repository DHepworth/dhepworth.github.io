<p>I listened to a very surprising interview with Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s son. The biggest surprise for me in the interview was that Ronald Reagan had a son, which somehow had escaped me until that moment. What was also shocking to me was what was said about the man&rsquo;s father, whom I had grown up believing was quite different from what was spoken of him in the interview. I had grown up in a culture that spoke of Ronald Reagan almost with reverence, believing him to be one of the last great leaders of the country. I had never felt a reason to question this thought, so I never investigated the history of the presidency.</p>

<p>This interview caused me to doubt the narrative I had heard throughout my life, so I began to investigate more about the man. I am shocked that I held a positive opinion of him for so long because the evidence was very available to contradict such a standpoint.</p>

<p>I found a series of podcast episodes that catalogued some of the more egregious issues with the man and his leadership, and it makes for a daunting list of problems. This is admittedly a biased look at the man and is intended to catalogue his faults, so I doubt this would ever be seen as a fair representation of him, but it feels like the antidote for the alternative that I understood of him.</p>

<h4><cite class="dash">The Washington Post</cite><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/post-reports/we-dont-even-think-about-race/" target="_blank">Post Reports: &lsquo;We Don&rsquo;t Even Think About Race&rsquo;</a></h4>

<blockquote cite="https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/post-reports/we-dont-even-think-about-race/">Traverse City, Mich., is a microcosm of the critical race theory debates taking over school systems across the country. The debates in the town came after the school board decided to fast-track an equity resolution, after students held a fake slave auction over Snapchat. Reporter Hannah Natanson went to Traverse City to understand what White parents think of the resolution and racism in the town, as well as how students feel.</blockquote>

<p>A challenging episode that showcases a culture clash between children and parents who see racism in the country differently and who should be in control of the culture in the classroom. It&rsquo;s a difficult thing to be a parent and find the balance between teaching a child about the world and shielding that child from the reality of the world. I think I want to be a parent who lets his children speak for themselves about the world that they see.</p>
