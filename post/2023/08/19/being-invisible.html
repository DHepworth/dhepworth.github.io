        <h2>Being invisible</h2>
        <p class="date">August 19th, 2023</p>
         <p>When we moved into our new house, my wife and I decided to purchase a couple seed packs of flowers to put in a garden in the back yard. We chose to purchase native wildflowers; we thought they would have the greatest chance of surviving and the variety of seeds included promised to provide a lot of colors and shapes of blossoms. We were overwhelmed by the assortment when they bloomed in the spring, and marveled at how beautiful and unique each flower was.</p>

<p>What was potentially even more stunning to us was the classification of “weed” for most of what grew. What we saw as incredibly valuable was deemed by others to be a nuisance, a plant worthy of destruction. We could not fully understand how someone could see such a gorgeous assortment and classify them in such low esteem.</p>

<p>The realization that value could be so wide in its interpretation was on my mind as I considered my internal image of myself. From my youth I have worked to lessen my consideration of my own value, thinking it a virtue to self-deprecate. I have self-assigned my personal contributions to work assignments and relationships to be of such a minimal worth because I thought it would be prideful to believe or accept any other interpretation. I ignored the compliments of others. I dismissed the evaluations of my worth unless it was at least as bad as my own estimation. I thought I was being a better person by hating myself.</p>

<p>Yet as I considered my prized flowers that others would deem repulsive, I wondered if my self-perception could be incorrect. Could I be poisoning my life with such a crushing view of myself? Could I be assigning the status of “weed” to my life?</p>

<p>For years I have battled the dissonance of wanting to be successful, which would result in some level of notoriety, with the ingrained view that any level of fame is a potential moral failing because being noticed could inevitably lead to pride and destruction of self. I chose invisibility as the default: better to be the wallflower and be a “good person” than to be popular and turn out a monster. Yet I found no joy in being unknown, for anonymity seemed cursed with an impotence to improve the lives of others. I was no superhero with vast caches of money or super-human abilities to hide my identity while greatly impacting others; instead, I was just hiding in the shadows of my community.</p>

<p>How was this misery and near-constant depression anything but a wasted life? I was making little of the changes that I aimed to make as a young adult. I was severely dependent on a few friendships that I constantly chided myself for having and regularly believed to be a case of pity for a slug like me. I was regularly rejecting the value that others assigned to me, inadvertently insulting them by throwing away the compliments they sent to me was a poor judgement of my character. I was being frivolous with the gifts of friendships and community because I thought it better to deprive myself of their joys — even guilty for feeling any sense of happiness. What a mistake.</p>

<p>I now aim to see my life as I see my flowers: they are valuable just by existing, waiting to be seen by others who also see their worth. They will not be treasured by hiding their petals: they must take the risk of being harmed or misrepresented by boldly throwing open their blossoms and calling for the attention of the creatures who will love them. There is no virtue in hiding; there is no absolute moral good in being invisible.</p>

<p>The memories I hold closest to me are the ones where people noticed me and loved me. There was a measure of shame associated with enjoying those memories, because I felt that it was wrong to be loved — I was, after all, supposed to avoid such feelings lest I fall to pride and vanity. But how can I find value in other humans if the one human I know the most — myself — I hate with such passion?</p>

<p>I want to see myself, like a flower, as being worthy of love. I know that I am not going to be loved by all, just as a weed may be culled by some and kept by others, but I think that the goal of finding some who see your beauty is worth the pain of being undervalued by others. I think that if I can start seeing myself as valuable and accepting that others can feel the same, I will be far more capable of sharing that same kind of love to others.</p>

<p>If a simple flower can find the courage to be visible, why not I?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Old grey-haired waitresses<br>
In cafes at night<br>
Have given it up,<br>
And as i walk down sidewalks of light<br>
And look into windows of nursing homes<br>
I can see that it is no longer with them.<br>
I see people sitting on park benches<br>
And i can see by the way they sit and look<br>
That it is gone.</i></p>
<p><i>I see people driving cars<br>
And I see by the way<br>
They drive their cars<br>
That they neither love nor are loved –<br>
Nor do they consider sex.<br>
It is all forgotten<br>
Like an old movie.</i></p>
<p><i>I see people in department stores and supermarkets<br>
Walking down aisles<br>
Buying things<br>
And i can see by the way their clothing<br>
Fits them and by the way they walk<br>
And by their faces and their eyes<br>
That they care for nothing<br>
And that nothing cares for them.</i></p>
<p><i>I see a hundred people a day<br>
Who have given up entirely.</i></p>
<p><i>If I go to the racetrack  or a sporting event<br>
I can see thousands that feel for nothing<br>
Or no one<br>
And get no feeling back.</i></p>
<p><i>Everywhere I see those who<br>
Crave nothing but food, shelter, and clothing;<br>
They concentrate on that,<br>
Dreamlessly</i></p>
<p><i>I do not understand why these people do not<br>
vanish<br>
I do not understand why these people do not<br>
expire<br>
Why the clouds do not murder them<br>
Or why the dogs do not murder them<br>
Or why the flowers and the children do not murder them,<br>
I do not understand.</i></p>
<p><i>I suppose they are murdered<br>
Yet i can’t adjust to the<br>
Fact of them<br>
Because they are so many.</i></p>
<p><i>Each day,<br>
Each night,<br>
There are more of them<br>
In the subways and<br>
In the buildings and<br>
In the parks</i></p>
<p><i>They feel no terror<br>
At not loving<br>
Or at not<br>
Being loved</i></p>
<p><i>So many many many<br>
Of my fellow creatures</i></p>

<h4><cite class="dash">Christine Emba — The Washington Post</cite><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/07/10/christine-emba-masculinity-new-model/" target="_blank">Men are lost. Here’s a map out of the wilderness.</a></h4>
<blockquote>Worrying about the state of our men is an American tradition. But today’s problems are real and well documented.</blockquote>
<p>I still regularly go through my own identity crisis of what it means to be a man. I don’t want to follow the traditional expectations of masculinity because many of them are troubling to me, but I’m still trying to figure out if there is anything unique about being a man outside of that tradition. I am happy that I am a human, but I want to find something about manhood that feels good to have without feeling bad for those who lack it.</p>
<p>Being a woman is not only impressive because of the physical attributes that can support life from within, but also the bravery and strength that comes from the ailments that occur from such a system. Menstruation, hormonal changes, pain, and disease is such a constant issue for women. I feel humbled about sharing my minor back pain from nerve damage when I consider what women face on a far more frequent basis. I don’t face the type of oppression, doubt, or danger that women do in all aspects of their life, so my minor inconveniences faced in life feel foolish to ever discuss. I have been given one of the easiest lives just by being born who I am, so should I feel any sense of accomplishment? I struggle to find a lot of who I am worthy of pride; very often I feel undeserving or shameful of what I have been provided just by being born a man.</p>
<p>Being a nice person can come from any sex — it’s the bare minimum I expect from any person. I want to find the element of manhood that is unique to that sex that brings goodness to the world and beauty to its existence, but feel I must continue searching.</p>
