        <p>I remember during the Covid-19 lockdown that I was surprisingly happy. I thought it was solely due to my misanthropic streak or that I was far more shy than I realized. However, after experiencing a couple of years of post-lockdown life (more so because Oklahoma was one of the defiantly anti-science states), I think my understanding of myself has grown and I now know why I felt so much better during Covid than I do now.</p>

<p>For years I have believed that I fully understood my psyche. But for as long as I was certain I knew myself best, I was also firm and vocal in my stance that I was introverted but not shy ‚Äî and I think I‚Äôve been wrong all this time. <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/scoptophobia-2671835" target="_blank">I don‚Äôt like being seen</a>.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe fear of being perceived‚Äù explains much of my anxiety about so many elements of social interaction. I thought I was introverted, but I can throw aside all inhibitions when playing a character in front of others. When I‚Äôm online and hidden from a camera, I feel witty and energized. I don‚Äôt feel held back by my physicality like I do when I have to stand in front of someone and look at them in the eyes.</p>

<p>Articles about this have floated on the internet for years now without my knowledge, so this new revelation for me might be old for everyone else.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know what to do with this knowledge, though. I‚Äôve battled with feeling isolated online because I‚Äôve long felt that in-person relationships were superior. I don‚Äôt know if that is something that I feel or if that‚Äôs something that someone else has put in my head through years of pro-extroversion indoctrination. After considering that perhaps it might not be a moral wrong to be the way I am nor that being extroverted is a virtue, I think I at least take comfort in potentially knowing more why I feel the way I do.</p>
