  <h2><a href="/post/2024/01/05/new-old-camera.html">My new old camera</a></h2>
  
  <p>For a period of time in my youth I fully expected to mature into an illustrator for children‚Äôs books. I found that pencils and charcoal were my favored tools, and I set about building my skills in the craft. The work was hard and I felt I was plateauing in mediocrity, increasing my doubts that I would ever manage to achieve the goals that I had set for myself. I perceived photography as an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù art form that I could comprehend, so I set about purchasing my first <abbr title="Single Lens Reflex">SLR</abbr> to try out photography.</p>

<p>I had played with cameras in the past and found moments within my point-and-shoot use where I felt genuinely moved by some of the photographs I managed to capture, but I felt limited by the tools and wanted to improve the quality of my work. I took many photos with my 35mm SLR camera but the cost of processing the film frustrated my learning speed, so I was very pleased when I was able to afford a digital camera. While my first digital camera was only 2 megapixels and a point-and-shoot, I grew much in my understanding of laying out a scene and trying different angles because I could immediately see the results of my work on the back of the camera. I quickly grew frustrated by the limitations of the image quality and hoped for a chance to get something better, which eventually came in the form of a much-better digital SLR.</p>

<p>One way I was able to achieve these goals was by working for one-hour film processors and camera retailers that offered discounts to employees; some of the equipment I still own was purchased during those years. I was a horrible camera sales associate, but I appreciated being able to be around cameras and see the various ways the manufacturers improved the cameras each year. I noticed a continual drop in build quality and features in the low-end point-and-shoot models; combined with my desire to finally purchase a digital SLR, I began to have a heavy disdain for many of the cheap models the general public purchased.</p>

<p>I think I made the right decision to pursue an SLR, but I missed out on the convenience of the point-and-shoot with my continued disdain for those models. With the advantage of time, I was able to look back at some of the better point-and-shoots that I missed, find one used at a terrific price, and get started on taking the random photos I would‚Äôve been disappointed with if taken from my cellphone.</p>

<p>The following photos were taken on a <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canon-powershot-sx150-is" target="_blank">Canon PowerShot SX150 IS</a> using the <a href="https://chdk.fandom.com/wiki/CHDK" target="_blank">CHDK firmware</a> to enable RAW shooting. In an indictment of the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/06/mkbhd-post-processing-ruining-iphone-photos/" target="_blank">photo quality of my iPhone 13 mini,</a> this camera takes pictures that I like, even if I have to put more effort into importing them into my Apple Photos collection. While I haven‚Äôt taken the next award-winning photograph with this camera, I have enjoyed being able to have something readily available that doesn‚Äôt look threatening or suspicious and ends up taking a photo I might want to share with someone.</p>

  <h3>Hopelessness in video games</h3>
  <p>I used to play a lot of video games. These days I settle for some games from my Apple Arcade subscription, but I used to have many mobile consoles, several home consoles, and a gaming PC. I played many titles across a variety of platforms, filling out a list of memorable games that left a permanent impact on my life. In a recent conversation with my coworkers I started listing my favorite games and learned that the games that I have felt the most important in my life were ones that generated a feeling of hopelessness. I certainly enjoy a variety of gaming genres and story types, but the ones I can recall with fondness are the ones that made me feel the most miserable.</p>

This will be a pedantic and antagonistic position.</p>

  <p>I need to tell you of a grave error that I made several years ago that has haunted me ever since: gaining knowledge will only lead you to sorrow. You will never be happier than you are now by learning about the things that intrigue you. Don‚Äôt fall into the same trap as me and ruin your life like I‚Äôve ruined mine. By investigating you expose your mind to nuance, new possibilities, difficult realities, and discomfort you didn‚Äôt believe imaginable, and it will permanently change you for the worse.</p>

  <h3>We aren‚Äôt asking the right questions</h3>
  <p>The penultimate episode of <em>The Rise & Fall of Mars Hill</em> is a frustrating investigatory experience. The show presents to the listener the evidence of an abusive pastor in a permissive church system, building the case that this was an ongoing problem within the organization that eventually collapsed under the weight of the trauma dealt within. What I believe the episode fails to do and has continued to do throughout the series is to follow that evidence to its obvious conclusion, despite the pretense of seeking answers for how it all happened.</p>

  <h3>An identity crisis</h3>
  <p>I grew up in an Evangelical Christian culture. I was taught that the primary life purpose of a Christian was to propagate the message of Christianity through evangelism, sharing the story of Jesus to people who did not know or believe what was written in the Bible. Through this effort, souls would be saved from eternal damnation and more people would be prepared for the return of the savior of humanity. This mission was time-sensitive, because the return of Jesus was possible at any moment, and that event could potentially seal the fate of all living on Earth.</p>

            Aggressive cost cutting and rocky leadership changes have eroded the culture at Boeing, a company once admired for its engineering rigor, says Bill George. What will it take to repair the reputational damage wrought by years of crises involving its 737 MAX?

            This is the generation now entering middle age in America, and while they have thoroughly memed the apparently insurmountable daily task of ‚Äúadulting,‚Äù they‚Äôre the ones who are reading Teen Vogue. They collect toys. They go to Disney World, unaccompanied by a minor, often alone, and on purpose. Troemel also notes that art galleries are morphing into adult playgrounds, where swing sets and ball pits are billed as ‚Äúinstallation pieces.‚Äù They read young adult fiction (rebranded as NA, or ‚Äúnew adult,‚Äù to maintain some semblance of plausible deniability), watch YA movies and TV, and are dutiful completists of every all-ages franchise they‚Äôre sold, from Pixar to Marvel. They need a nap, and a treat, and time to scroll through a million instructional ‚Äúadulting‚Äù videos that teach them how to poach an egg or fold their clothes, not to mention the ‚Äô90s kids nostalgia memes and posts to remind them of a past they may very well remember fondly ‚Äî even a bit wistfully ‚Äî but should have long outgrown.
