  <h2><a href="/post/2023/11/15/knowledge-shouldnt-be-a-burden.html">Knowledge shouldn’t be a burden</a></h2>
  
  <p>I call myself an introvert <a href="https://www.vipshek.com/blog/interaction" target="_blank">but I wonder sometimes if I’m wrong.</a> I like to talk a lot, just only about a few things. I deeply enjoy sharing with someone else what I have learned about my favorite subjects. I think learning is a social act, with the reward of learning something being the opportunity to share that new understanding with someone else. What is to be done when some knowledge is seen as a threat? Gaining that sort of knowledge transforms an exhilarating social act into an incredibly effective form of self-isolation.</p>

<p>Knowledge seems amoral to me, and learning seems to be as close to a virtue as one could consider. Yet I too, despite my hunger to learn more, can recall with pangs of guilt the council of my youth that considered the act of learning a path riddled with danger, prone to leading a person to destruction if they were not careful. Some things were seen as so antagonistic to a learner that even an idle consideration of such things was a flirtation with the unethical. There was hidden enemy around every paragraph of unapproved text. <a href="/post/2022/02/03/anxious-about-being-ignorant.html">I didn’t want to remain ignorant</a>, but learning even the smallest new piece of information seems to carry a huge cost to a vast array of elements in my life. Could I find a way to feel comfort in understanding more?</p>

<p>I am fairly certain that I now know why such a practice of fear of knowledge is fostered in some communities: it is essential to that community’s continued existence that its adherents avoid the pursuit of individual and unguided learning. To learn for oneself is to seek out truth without a stranger’s heavy hand guiding one’s conclusions toward a definitive goal. To understand the complexity of things is to unearth shades of gray instead of the stark contrast of dogma. I could sense that breaking through this programming would be to my benefit, but every step forward felt like a violation. Not everyone wants to take those steps, and that’s where my isolation begins.</p>

    </blockquote>
</div>

<p>I’m not a scholar, I’ve done no independent research, and my recall of details is still often dependent on the bookmarks and search results that I’ve saved over the years. I don’t claim to be a subject matter expert in potentially any area. I am not a better person than someone else because I have read a book. My self-actualization isn’t the element that will redeem the world or is of much value to someone else. Yet I still really enjoy becoming more educated in an increasing number of the subjects most interesting to me. In some of these subjects I have found vast stretches of information new to me that have thrilled me in their discovery. I have longed for an opportunity to share or discuss this information, but what I have learned is that with each new piece of information, I have inadvertently isolated myself. First, there is a shared language lost in this learning. What seemed obvious and beyond debate to me before now feels open to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/04/AR2006030401369.html" target="_blank">skepticism and consideration,</a> so I no longer have a solid shared foundation on which to call in conversations. Even agreements on simple definitions have to be made first in order to have a conversation. Secondly, I have found that this knowledge, because of how interesting it is, increases specialization and focus on elements which may not be as interesting or desired by others. This limits my potential conversational opportunities over time, increasing my chances of loneliness. Thirdly, sharing this information triggers the listener with the same anxieties I faced in my youthful culture of fear, making me become an enemy instead of a curious reader.</p>

<p>I feel that I’m reading too cold and analytical in this post. I don’t know how to share more. I think I’m just coping and trying to survive with what I’ve learned. There are times where I wonder if that phrase “ignorance is bliss” may be one of the wisest words ever written. I like knowing so much more about life and the complexities of cultures and governments, but it weighs me down to see how much more pain there is in the world than I realized and how I likely directly contributed to its continuation. I think we could all empathize with each other more by being better educated.</p>

<p>Did all this knowledge change me for the better or has it ruined me? I feel that I can <a href="/post/2021/10/26/an-identity-crisis.html">love so much better and more deeply than before,</a> but now I feel more lonely when I would have expected to feel closer to community. I am both the same person and yet very different. I <a href="/post/2022/06/10/feeling-stuck.html">still see the same world as before</a> but my definitions have changed and my expectations of <a href="/post/2021/11/26/we-arent-asking-the-right-questions.html">what is acceptable have been altered</a>. My goals of loving others are still there, but the methods aren’t what they were. Having all this within me keeps me feeling both the best I’ve ever felt and the worst I hope to ever experience. I have fantasized sometimes about having my memory wiped and what that would mean for me, but I don’t think I could do it. I prize my experiences but I wish I had more people around me with whom to share it.</p>

<p>One might conclude that I should have accepted the advice from those who warned me not to tread in these spaces, but I believe that the struggle to learn is always the better solution to ignorance, even when it carries a heavy cost.</p>

  <h3>Being invisible</h3>
  <p>From my youth I have worked to lessen my consideration of my own value, thinking it a virtue to self-deprecate. I thought I was being a better person by hating myself. Eventually, I wondered if my self-perception could be incorrect. Could I be poisoning my life with such a crushing view of my value?</p>

  <h3>Hopelessness in video games</h3>
  <p>I used to play a lot of video games. These days I settle for some games from my Apple Arcade subscription, but I used to have many mobile consoles, several home consoles, and a gaming PC. I played many titles across a variety of platforms, filling out a list of memorable games that left a permanent impact on my life. In a recent conversation with my coworkers I started listing my favorite games and learned that the games that I have felt the most important in my life were ones that generated a feeling of hopelessness. I certainly enjoy a variety of gaming genres and story types, but the ones I can recall with fondness are the ones that made me feel the most miserable.</p>

  <p>I don’t like analog clocks. People have tried to persuade me and have shown me the obvious benefits to using such a platform, but I continue to remain unconvinced and I feel that I have good reason for my opinion. I will now present a rather adversarial and controversial view of why analog clocks are inferior to the newer digital clock method of presenting time. This will be a pedantic and antagonistic position.</p>

  <h3>Parasocial relationships are weird</h3>
  <p>Parasocial relationships are strange. They feel closer than some friendships but are hollow facsimiles, barely reaching beyond the level of acquaintance. They are unequal connections.

  <h3>Feeling stuck</h3>
  <p>I need to tell you of a grave error that I made several years ago that has haunted me ever since: gaining knowledge will only lead you to sorrow. You will never be happier than you are now by learning about the things that intrigue you. Don’t fall into the same trap as me and ruin your life like I’ve ruined mine. By investigating you expose your mind to nuance, new possibilities, difficult realities, and discomfort you didn’t believe imaginable, and it will permanently change you for the worse.</p>

  <h3>I used to be anxious about being thought of as ignorant</h3>
  <p>In the past few years I think I have started to learn that empathy, comprehension, growth, understanding, joy, and contentment come not from being more certain about what one knows but from accepting how little can be known by any one person in a lifetime. I may be more at peace now, but the process to get to this point was potentially the most painful and disruptive I’ve yet to experience.</p>

  <h3>We aren’t asking the right questions</h3>
  <p>The penultimate episode of <em>The Rise & Fall of Mars Hill</em> is a frustrating investigatory experience. The show presents to the listener the evidence of an abusive pastor in a permissive church system, building the case that this was an ongoing problem within the organization that eventually collapsed under the weight of the trauma dealt within. What I believe the episode fails to do and has continued to do throughout the series is to follow that evidence to its obvious conclusion, despite the pretense of seeking answers for how it all happened.</p>

  <h3>An identity crisis</h3>
  <p>I grew up in an Evangelical Christian culture. I was taught that the primary life purpose of a Christian was to propagate the message of Christianity through evangelism, sharing the story of Jesus to people who did not know or believe what was written in the Bible. Through this effort, souls would be saved from eternal damnation and more people would be prepared for the return of the savior of humanity. This mission was time-sensitive, because the return of Jesus was possible at any moment, and that event could potentially seal the fate of all living on Earth.</p>

  <p>Life during the COVID-19 pandemic has been lonelier than I expected.
