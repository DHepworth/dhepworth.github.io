  <h2><a href="/post/2023/11/28/fun-side-project.html">My fun side project — inspired by the 2020 Apple event</a></h2>
  
  <p>I liked the aesthetic of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/KR0g-1hnQPA?si=AmHCsABjAVYTHXmf&amp;t=3763" target="_blank">advertisement for the iPhone 12 Pro that Apple did years ago.</a> I wanted to remake it in HTML as much as I could, so I used this project to build a list of links to my social network profiles.</p>

<p>First, I wanted to get the colors of the sunrise from the video, <a href="https://cssgradient.io" target="_blank">so I went to a tool online,</a> and uploaded a cropped shot of the sky to grab the colors from it to make a linear-gradient. I tweaked the results and set it up on the page.</p>

<p>In order to make the gradient image appear more filmic, I used the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/grainy-gradients/" target="_blank">tool mentioned by CSS-Tricks</a> to build an SVG file of noise for use as a mask-image in CSS.</p>

<p>I then went back to the video and captured a screenshot of the mountain range, tracing over the resulting image in <a href="https://www.vectornator.io" target="_blank">Vectornator.</a> I customized it to be wider and more varied, experimenting with horizon level, until I exported a final SVG that I then compressed in <a href="https://imageoptim.com" target="_blank">ImageOptim.</a></p>

<p>Finally, for the stars in the sky I went to NASA and browsed their image gallery until I found an <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/the-city-lights-at-the-intersection-of-europe-and-asia" target="_blank">appropriate photo of stars.</a></p>

<p>I then built the CSS with animations, filters, gradients, mask-images, and shadows to make a glimmering interface.</p>

  <h3>Knowledge shouldn’t be a burden</h3>

  <h3>Being invisible</h3>
  <p>From my youth I have worked to lessen my consideration of my own value, thinking it a virtue to self-deprecate. I thought I was being a better person by hating myself. Eventually, I wondered if my self-perception could be incorrect. Could I be poisoning my life with such a crushing view of my value?</p>

  <h3>Hopelessness in video games</h3>
  <p>I used to play a lot of video games. These days I settle for some games from my Apple Arcade subscription, but I used to have many mobile consoles, several home consoles, and a gaming PC. I played many titles across a variety of platforms, filling out a list of memorable games that left a permanent impact on my life. In a recent conversation with my coworkers I started listing my favorite games and learned that the games that I have felt the most important in my life were ones that generated a feeling of hopelessness. I certainly enjoy a variety of gaming genres and story types, but the ones I can recall with fondness are the ones that made me feel the most miserable.</p>

  <h3>The time for analog clocks is over</h3>
  <p>I don’t like analog clocks. People have tried to persuade me and have shown me the obvious benefits to using such a platform, but I continue to remain unconvinced and I feel that I have good reason for my opinion. I will now present a rather adversarial and controversial view of why analog clocks are inferior to the newer digital clock method of presenting time. This will be a pedantic and antagonistic position.</p>

  <h3>Flooding and school shootings</h3>
  <p>The fragility of life is rarely more realized than in the moments surrounding a natural disaster. In the normalcy of daily routines, we all can fall numb to the potential dangers present in our world. To stay vigilant would be exhausting, so we avoid considering them until the signs of something terrible approaching are too obvious to ignore.</p>

  <h3>Parasocial relationships are weird</h3>
  <p>Parasocial relationships are strange. They feel closer than some friendships but are hollow facsimiles, barely reaching beyond the level of acquaintance. They are unequal connections. They do not mutually benefit all participants. Why then does losing a connection to a stranger feel nearly as bittersweet as a true bond with a known companion?</p>

  <h3>Feeling stuck</h3>
  <p>I need to tell you of a grave error that I made several years ago that has haunted me ever since: gaining knowledge will only lead you to sorrow. You will never be happier than you are now by learning about the things that intrigue you. Don’t fall into the same trap as me and ruin your life like I’ve ruined mine. By investigating you expose your mind to nuance, new possibilities, difficult realities, and discomfort you didn’t believe imaginable, and it will permanently change you for the worse.</p>

  <h3>I used to be anxious about being thought of as ignorant</h3>
  <p>In the past few years I think I have started to learn that empathy, comprehension, growth, understanding, joy, and contentment come not from being more certain about what one knows but from accepting how little can be known by any one person in a lifetime. I may be more at peace now, but the process to get to this point was potentially the most painful and disruptive I’ve yet to experience.</p>

  <h3>Now on Jekyll</h3>
  <p>This little side project is now built with Jekyll, a site deployment tool that was surprisingly easy to set up. Its simple controls allow me to quickly build the site into HTML files very similar to ones that I was writing before, but without all the hard work of maintaining code throughout each page. Now I can write posts in a simpler fashion and start to add new features with greater ease than if I continued coding everything by hand.</p>

  <h3>We aren’t asking the right questions</h3>
  <p>The penultimate episode of <em>The Rise & Fall of Mars Hill</em> is a frustrating investigatory experience. The show presents to the listener the evidence of an abusive pastor in a permissive church system, building the case that this was an ongoing problem within the organization that eventually collapsed under the weight of the trauma dealt within. What I believe the episode fails to do and has continued to do throughout the series is to follow that evidence to its obvious conclusion, despite the pretense of seeking answers for how it all happened.</p>

  <h3>An identity crisis</h3>
  <p>I grew up in an Evangelical Christian culture. I was taught that the primary life purpose of a Christian was to propagate the message of Christianity through evangelism, sharing the story of Jesus to people who did not know or believe what was written in the Bible. Through this effort, souls would be saved from eternal damnation and more people would be prepared for the return of the savior of humanity. This mission was time-sensitive, because the return of Jesus was possible at any moment, and that event could potentially seal the fate of all living on Earth.</p>

  <h3>We know less than we realize, but that’s okay</h3>
  <p>Life during the COVID-19 pandemic has been lonelier than I expected. My introversion has been useful in this time of isolation, but it did not prepare me for the simultaneous crushing ideological loneliness that has come from watching others respond to the demands of the pandemic. I feel more disconnected from my peers now than I ever have before.</p>

  <h3>The time that I learned about Ronald Reagan</h3>
  <p>I had grown up in a culture that spoke of Ronald Reagan almost with reverence, believing him to be one of the last great leaders of the country. I had never felt a reason to question this thought, so I never investigated the history of the presidency. This interview caused me to doubt the narrative I had heard throughout my life.</p>

Although the full scope of Carr’s history remains out of public view, The Post unearthed new details through public records that show that, over two decades, efforts by officials in multiple states to prevent her from practicing have largely failed.

          <blockquote cite="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/15/amazon_in_person_mandate/">
            Amazon is warning employees they risk undermining their own promotion prospects unless they return to the office (RTO) for three days a week, as was mandated by CEO Andy Jassy months ago.

            Vehicles with especially tall front ends are most dangerous to pedestrians, but a blunt profile makes medium-height vehicles deadly too, new research from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety shows.

            In a bombshell 2020 study, University of Washington researchers directly tied 6PPD, a chemical in tires intended to prolong the products’ life, to the collapse of coho salmon populations in Puget Sound. 6PPD reacts with air to become 6PPD-quinone, a compound so toxic that exposure to even tiny concentrations in water can induce “acute mortality” in fish, according to the study.
