  <h2><a href="/post/2023/08/19/being-invisible.html">Being invisible</a></h2>
  
  <p>When we moved into our new house, my wife and I decided to purchase a couple seed packs of flowers to put in a garden in the back yard. We chose to purchase native wildflowers; we thought they would have the greatest chance of surviving and the variety of seeds included promised to provide a lot of colors and shapes of blossoms. We were overwhelmed by the assortment when they bloomed in the spring, and marveled at how beautiful and unique each flower was.</p>

<p>What was potentially even more stunning to us was the classification of “weed” for most of what grew. What we saw as incredibly valuable was deemed by others to be a nuisance, a plant worthy of destruction. We could not fully understand how someone could see such a gorgeous assortment and classify them in such low esteem.</p>

<p>The realization that value could be so wide in its interpretation was on my mind as I considered my internal image of myself. From my youth I have worked to lessen my consideration of my own value, thinking it a virtue to self-deprecate. I have self-assigned my personal contributions to work assignments and relationships to be of such a minimal worth because I thought it would be prideful to believe or accept any other interpretation. I ignored the compliments of others. I dismissed the evaluations of my worth unless it was at least as bad as my own estimation. I thought I was being a better person by hating myself.</p>

<p>Yet as I considered my prized flowers that others would deem repulsive, I wondered if my self-perception could be incorrect. Could I be poisoning my life with such a crushing view of myself? Could I be assigning the status of “weed” to my life?</p>

<p>For years I have battled the dissonance of wanting to be successful, which would result in some level of notoriety, with the ingrained view that any level of fame is a potential moral failing because being noticed could inevitably lead to pride and destruction of self. I chose invisibility as the default: better to be the wallflower and be a “good person” than to be popular and turn out a monster. Yet I found no joy in being unknown, for anonymity seemed cursed with an impotence to improve the lives of others. I was no superhero with vast caches of money or super-human abilities to hide my identity while greatly impacting others; instead, I was just hiding in the shadows of my community.</p>

<p>How was this misery and near-constant depression anything but a wasted life? I was making little of the changes that I aimed to make as a young adult. I was severely dependent on a few friendships that I constantly chided myself for having and regularly believed to be a case of pity for a slug like me. I was regularly rejecting the value that others assigned to me, inadvertently insulting them by throwing away the compliments they sent to me was a poor judgement of my character. I was being frivolous with the gifts of friendships and community because I thought it better to deprive myself of their joys — even guilty for feeling any sense of happiness. What a mistake.</p>

<p>I now aim to see my life as I see my flowers: they are valuable just by existing, waiting to be seen by others who also see their worth. They will not be treasured by hiding their petals: they must take the risk of being harmed or misrepresented by boldly throwing open their blossoms and calling for the attention of the creatures who will love them. There is no virtue in hiding; there is no absolute moral good in being invisible.</p>

<p>The memories I hold closest to me are the ones where people noticed me and loved me. There was a measure of shame associated with enjoying those memories, because I felt that it was wrong to be loved — I was, after all, supposed to avoid such feelings lest I fall to pride and vanity. But how can I find value in other humans if the one human I know the most — myself — I hate with such passion?</p>

<p>I want to see myself, like a flower, as being worthy of love. I know that I am not going to be loved by all, just as a weed may be culled by some and kept by others, but I think that the goal of finding some who see your beauty is worth the pain of being undervalued by others. I think that if I can start seeing myself as valuable and accepting that others can feel the same, I will be far more capable of sharing that same kind of love to others.</p>

<p>If a simple flower can find the courage to be visible, why not I?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Old grey-haired waitresses<br>
In cafes at night<br>
Have given it up,<br>
And as i walk down sidewalks of light<br>
And look into windows of nursing homes<br>
I can see that it is no longer with them.<br>
I see people sitting on park benches<br>
And i can see by the way they sit and look<br>
That it is gone.</i></p>
<p><i>I see people driving cars<br>
And I see by the way<br>
They drive their cars<br>
That they neither love nor are loved –<br>
Nor do they consider sex.<br>
It is all forgotten<br>
Like an old movie.</i></p>
<p><i>I see people in department stores and supermarkets<br>
Walking down aisles<br>
Buying things<br>
And i can see by the way their clothing<br>
Fits them and by the way they walk<br>
And by their faces and their eyes<br>
That they care for nothing<br>
And that nothing cares for them.</i></p>
<p><i>I see a hundred people a day<br>
Who have given up entirely.</i></p>
<p><i>If I go to the racetrack  or a sporting event<br>
I can see thousands that feel for nothing<br>
Or no one<br>
And get no feeling back.</i></p>
<p><i>Everywhere I see those who<br>
Crave nothing but food, shelter, and clothing;<br>
They concentrate on that,<br>
Dreamlessly</i></p>
<p><i>I do not understand why these people do not<br>
vanish<br>
I do not understand why these people do not<br>
expire<br>
Why the clouds do not murder them<br>
Or why the dogs do not murder them<br>
Or why the flowers and the children do not murder them,<br>
I do not understand.</i></p>
<p><i>I suppose they are murdered<br>
Yet i can’t adjust to the<br>
Fact of them<br>
Because they are so many.</i></p>
<p><i>Each day,<br>
Each night,<br>
There are more of them<br>
In the subways and<br>
In the buildings and<br>
In the parks</i></p>
<p><i>They feel no terror<br>
At not loving<br>
Or at not<br>
Being loved</i></p>
<p><i>So many many many<br>
Of my fellow creatures</i></p>

<blockquote>Worrying about the state of our men is an American tradition. But today’s problems are real and well documented.</blockquote>

<p>The culture in which I was raised had specific traits and responsibilities imposed on the sexes. One who strayed too far from those characteristics was threatening one’s own status as that sex. I was never comfortable adjusting my personality to fit that mold, so I spent years of my life feeling like a nomad among the cultural norms, morally, mentally, and physically failing the expectations of the system. I didn’t want to follow the traditional expectations of masculinity because many of them remain troubling to me. So much about being a man seemed built as a constrast to the traits of a woman, but handled primarily in an antagonistic and domineering manner that was used as a tool to humiliate and objectify women.</p>

<p>Seeking an alternative to this system has been difficult. I feel conditioned to see differences where none may exist. I still feel anxious that I don’t have a specific list of unique qualities that would define me as a man, even though I never felt a connection to nor felt any comfort in being limited to such a list. I doubt my value without those characteristics as a tool to define me. It is as if I lack an identity if I can’t compare myself to a set of qualities that someone else chose for me.</p>

<p>I don’t think the solution is to seek the answers from someone like Jordan Peterson or Joe Rogan; that seems to be a return to restricting my life to someone else’s definition of what it is to be a man. I’m not convinced that any list is actually necessary to my life in the way it once seemed. I think I want to rearrange my list of my identity and place “man” in a mere attribute of me rather than the word under which everything is defined. I think handling it this way will mean I no longer try to consider how a “man” would approach a situation and instead let “David” (that’s me) get involved.</p>

  <h3>Hopelessness in video games</h3>
  <p>I used to play a lot of video games. These days I settle for some games from my Apple Arcade subscription, but I used to have many mobile consoles, several home consoles, and a gaming PC. I played many titles across a variety of platforms, filling out a list of memorable games that left a permanent impact on my life. In a recent conversation with my coworkers I started listing my favorite games and learned that the games that I have felt the most important in my life were ones that generated a feeling of hopelessness. I certainly enjoy a variety of gaming genres and story types, but the ones I can recall with fondness are the ones that made me feel the most miserable.</p>

  <h3>The time for analog clocks is over</h3>
  <p>I don’t like analog clocks. People have tried to persuade me and have shown me the obvious benefits to using such a platform, but I continue to remain unconvinced and I feel that I have good reason for my opinion. I will now present a rather adversarial and controversial view of why analog clocks are inferior to the newer digital clock method of presenting time. This will be a pedantic and antagonistic position.</p>

  <p>The fragility of life is rarely more realized than in the moments surrounding a natural disaster.

  <h3>Parasocial relationships are weird</h3>
  <p>Parasocial relationships are strange. They feel closer than some friendships but are hollow facsimiles, barely reaching beyond the level of acquaintance. They are unequal connections. They do not mutually benefit all participants. Why then does losing a connection to a stranger feel nearly as bittersweet as a true bond with a known companion?</p>

  <h3>Feeling stuck</h3>
  <p>I need to tell you of a grave error that I made several years ago that has haunted me ever since: gaining knowledge will only lead you to sorrow. You will never be happier than you are now by learning about the things that intrigue you. Don’t fall into the same trap as me and ruin your life like I’ve ruined mine. By investigating you expose your mind to nuance, new possibilities, difficult realities, and discomfort you didn’t believe imaginable, and it will permanently change you for the worse.</p>

  <h3>I used to be anxious about being thought of as ignorant</h3>
  <p>In the past few years I think I have started to learn that empathy, comprehension, growth, understanding, joy, and contentment come not from being more certain about what one knows but from accepting how little can be known by any one person in a lifetime. I may be more at peace now, but the process to get to this point was potentially the most painful and disruptive I’ve yet to experience.</p>

Its simple controls allow me to quickly build the site into HTML files very similar to ones that I was writing before, but without all the hard work of maintaining code throughout each page. Now I can write posts in a simpler fashion and start to add new features with greater ease than if I continued coding everything by hand.</p>

  <h3>We aren’t asking the right questions</h3>
  <p>The penultimate episode of <em>The Rise & Fall of Mars Hill</em> is a frustrating investigatory experience. The show presents to the listener the evidence of an abusive pastor in a permissive church system, building the case that this was an ongoing problem within the organization that eventually collapsed under the weight of the trauma dealt within. What I believe the episode fails to do and has continued to do throughout the series is to follow that evidence to its obvious conclusion, despite the pretense of seeking answers for how it all happened.</p>

  <h3>An identity crisis</h3>
  <p>I grew up in an Evangelical Christian culture. I was taught that the primary life purpose of a Christian was to propagate the message of Christianity through evangelism, sharing the story of Jesus to people who did not know or believe what was written in the Bible. Through this effort, souls would be saved from eternal damnation and more people would be prepared for the return of the savior of humanity. This mission was time-sensitive, because the return of Jesus was possible at any moment, and that event could potentially seal the fate of all living on Earth.</p>

  <p>Life during the COVID-19 pandemic has been lonelier than I expected.

          <blockquote cite="https://radleybalko.substack.com/p/roundup-racially-disproportionate">
            The New York Civil Liberties Union released data to the Gothamist that shows staggering racial disparities among interactions by the New York Police Department under the leadership of former cop turned mayor Eric Adams. Just 5 percent of NYPD pedestrian were white. Meanwhile, 72 percent of Blacks and Latinos stopped were innocent. Adams’ tenure has also seen the most police stops since 2015, including 670,000 traffic stops, among which 90% of those arrested were Black or Latino. NYPD mandates officers to report the cause for a stop, yet 92 percent of stops ambiguously list “fits a relevant description” or “other” as the reason officers initiated the stop.

            More than a year after Roe v. Wade was overturned and abortion was mostly outlawed in Texas, anti-abortion groups are getting more aggressive -- and creative -- in trying to stop women from getting the procedure out of state. New laws currently on the table in many smaller Texas towns would make it illegal to even drive through the city or county for the purpose of an abortion.

            A new study from the Danish Road Directorate shows that less than 5% of cyclists break traffic laws while riding yet 66% of motorists do so when driving. The Danish Cycling Embassy, a privately-funded NGO, puts this down to visibility: law breaking by cyclists is “easy to notice for everyone” but transgressions by motorists, such as speeding, are harder to spot.

            Several new NBA arenas, including the Golden State Warriors' $1.4 billion Chase Center and the Los Angeles Clippers' forthcoming $2 billion Intuit Dome, have been 100% privately financed, a reasonable approach for profitable businesses owned by very wealthy people. Other NBA owners have secured public financing for new facilities. But even compared to these teams, the Thunder deal stands out.

            At first glance, CPCs appear to provide information and assistance to pregnant people, but their real purpose is to target people seeking abortion care and try to stop them from having an abortion. Now, some blue states are taking steps to limit the reach and funding of these centers. Red states, meanwhile, continue to shovel money at these misinformation-driven organizations.
