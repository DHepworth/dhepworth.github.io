  <h2><a href="/post/2023/06/01/what-is-church.html">What is church?</a></h2>
  
  <p><strong>Why does the average American Evangelical attend church? What are their goals, and do they find those goals met?</strong></p>

<p>My history in the Christian church began in my childhood. Most of the sermons I heard came from my father, standing near (but not behind ‚Äî his personal preference) the pulpit of whatever church we were attending at the time. My father pastored several churches throughout my time in the family home, sometimes in church buildings and sometimes in the house of one of the people in attendance. I love my experiences in those years and the communities that formed.</p>

<p>I had a bit of an adversarial approach to other churches in the community. I matured in a somewhat sequestered monoculture, often not being exposed to denominations or viewpoints that didn‚Äôt match those of my mentors. As a result, I saw anyone else who disagreed with me as being sadly misinformed to morally degraded, so I kept to my community because I was certain that we were what remained of ‚Äútrue Christians‚Äù.</p>

<p>I retained this mindset even after leaving the family home and moving across the country to Oklahoma for a job. For about a year I continued to live-stream my father‚Äôs sermons because I was certain that there was no other decent church available, even in the ‚ÄúBible Belt‚Äù of Oklahoma. When I finally felt it was time to build a community of friends in my local community, I visited with deep trepidation my first non-denominational church in my life and the first non-father-led church in years.</p>

<p>While I had a few prickly moments of uncertainty about the methods of the sermons and the culture of and practices in the church, I discovered that I appreciated learning different views on Bible verses and stories. I began to better understand the differences between denominations and doctrines and why they were a struggle for so many. I met my wife at this time and we both began regularly attending this church with our friends.</p>

<p>Eventually we began attending a small group, where we had our own little Bible study time and then casual conversation around a few snacks. The church didn‚Äôt have a good structure around small groups, so when that small group‚Äôs leaders chose to step away from their roles, the process to reintegrate felt chaotic and mostly hopeless. After finding little success in forming a new group and tiring of the sermons that had begun to feel confined in their scope and study, we moved to a new church farther down the street.</p>

<p>The new church didn‚Äôt have small groups outside of church hours but instead had ‚ÄúSunday School‚Äù, in the sense that the small groups attended either right before or after the sermon on Sunday. This felt like a step backward in terms of building a community, so it was on to the next church.</p>

<p>The new church had wildly different views on Christian doctrine, so that was a short-lived visit. Besides, it was time to move to Houston for a new job.</p>

<p>The process continued in Houston. The experiences were the same when we returned to Oklahoma. I shared with my wife my beloved memories of childhood church attendance, but we couldn‚Äôt find a match in culture in any of the churches I attended.</p>

<p>Was my childhood mentality of the American church being weak being proven true? Had I made a decade-long mistake in choosing to give any one of these churches a chance? Were the only good churches those found in my past? Or was there perhaps a deeper problem of which I was only now becoming aware?</p>

  <h3>Hopelessness in video games</h3>
  <p>I used to play a lot of video games. These days I settle for some games from my Apple Arcade subscription, but I used to have many mobile consoles, several home consoles, and a gaming PC. I played many titles across a variety of platforms, filling out a list of memorable games that left a permanent impact on my life. In a recent conversation with my coworkers I started listing my favorite games and learned that the games that I have felt the most important in my life were ones that generated a feeling of hopelessness. I certainly enjoy a variety of gaming genres and story types, but the ones I can recall with fondness are the ones that made me feel the most miserable.</p>

  <h3>The time for analog clocks is over</h3>
  <p>I don‚Äôt like analog clocks. People have tried to persuade me and have shown me the obvious benefits to using such a platform, but I continue to remain unconvinced and I feel that I have good reason for my opinion. I will now present a rather adversarial and controversial view of why analog clocks are inferior to the newer digital clock method of presenting time. This will be a pedantic and antagonistic position.</p>

  <h3>Flooding and school shootings</h3>
  <p>The fragility of life is rarely more realized than in the moments surrounding a natural disaster. In the normalcy of daily routines, we all can fall numb to the potential dangers present in our world. To stay vigilant would be exhausting, so we avoid considering them until the signs of something terrible approaching are too obvious to ignore.</p>

  <h3>Parasocial relationships are weird</h3>
  <p>Parasocial relationships are strange. They feel closer than some friendships but are hollow facsimiles, barely reaching beyond the level of acquaintance. They are unequal connections. They do not mutually benefit all participants. Why then does losing a connection to a stranger feel nearly as bittersweet as a true bond with a known companion?</p>

  <h3>Feeling stuck</h3>
  <p>I need to tell you of a grave error that I made several years ago that has haunted me ever since: gaining knowledge will only lead you to sorrow. You will never be happier than you are now by learning about the things that intrigue you. Don‚Äôt fall into the same trap as me and ruin your life like I‚Äôve ruined mine. By investigating you expose your mind to nuance, new possibilities, difficult realities, and discomfort you didn‚Äôt believe imaginable, and it will permanently change you for the worse.</p>

  <h3>I used to be anxious about being thought of as ignorant</h3>
  <p>In the past few years I think I have started to learn that empathy, comprehension, growth, understanding, joy, and contentment come not from being more certain about what one knows but from accepting how little can be known by any one person in a lifetime. I may be more at peace now, but the process to get to this point was potentially the most painful and disruptive I‚Äôve yet to experience.</p>

  <h3>Now on Jekyll</h3>
  <p>This little side project is now built with Jekyll, a site deployment tool that was surprisingly easy to set up. Its simple controls allow me to quickly build the site into HTML files very similar to ones that I was writing before, but without all the hard work of maintaining code throughout each page. Now I can write posts in a simpler fashion and start to add new features with greater ease than if I continued coding everything by hand.</p>

  <h3>We aren‚Äôt asking the right questions</h3>
  <p>The penultimate episode of <em>The Rise & Fall of Mars Hill</em> is a frustrating investigatory experience. The show presents to the listener the evidence of an abusive pastor in a permissive church system, building the case that this was an ongoing problem within the organization that eventually collapsed under the weight of the trauma dealt within. What I believe the episode fails to do and has continued to do throughout the series is to follow that evidence to its obvious conclusion, despite the pretense of seeking answers for how it all happened.</p>

  <h3>An identity crisis</h3>
  <p>I grew up in an Evangelical Christian culture. I was taught that the primary life purpose of a Christian was to propagate the message of Christianity through evangelism, sharing the story of Jesus to people who did not know or believe what was written in the Bible. Through this effort, souls would be saved from eternal damnation and more people would be prepared for the return of the savior of humanity. This mission was time-sensitive, because the return of Jesus was possible at any moment, and that event could potentially seal the fate of all living on Earth.</p>

  <h3>We know less than we realize, but that‚Äôs okay</h3>
  <p>Life during the COVID-19 pandemic has been lonelier than I expected. My introversion has been useful in this time of isolation, but it did not prepare me for the simultaneous crushing ideological loneliness that has come from watching others respond to the demands of the pandemic. I feel more disconnected from my peers now than I ever have before.</p>

  <h3>The time that I learned about Ronald Reagan</h3>
  <p>I had grown up in a culture that spoke of Ronald Reagan almost with reverence, believing him to be one of the last great leaders of the country. I had never felt a reason to question this thought, so I never investigated the history of the presidency. This interview caused me to doubt the narrative I had heard throughout my life.</p>

Apollo's developer, Christian Selig, has been in meetings with Reddit regarding the cost of the API, and it sounds like the company is using a recent Twitter tactic. Selig says, ‚Äú50 million requests costs $12,000, a figure far more than I ever could have imagined.‚Äù Twitter, for the record, is charging $42,000 for 50 million tweets. Selig cites the photo site Imgur as a more reasonable pricing scheme, ‚ÄúI pay Imgur (a site similar to Reddit in user base and media) $166 for the same 50 million API calls.‚Äù Selig estimates it would cost $20 million a year to keep Apollo running.</blockquote>
              <p>Reddit said that its API price increase was going to be fair, but it really seems that they are mirroring the hostility <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-data-api-prices-out-nearly-everyone/" target="_blank">Twitter recently displayed to third parties</a> by increasing the price to a level that will be certain to kill all third-party applications. What worries me is that so much consolidation has occurred throughout the web that both Twitter and Reddit will see no repercussions for their actions.</p>

            So many Christian churches in the United States do so much good‚Ä¶ But like in any community of faith, there is also sin ‚Äî often silenced, ignored and denied ‚Äî and it is much more common than many want to believe. It has often led to failures by evangelicals to report sexual abuse, respond appropriately to victims and change the institutional cultures that enabled the abuse in the first place.

            There are so many disturbing moments in the documentary series ‚ÄúShiny Happy People: Duggar Family Secrets‚Äù ‚Äî about the prolific family behind the saccharine reality TV hits ‚Äú19 Kids and Counting‚Äù and ‚ÄúCounting On‚Äù ‚Äî that it‚Äôs difficult to pinpoint the most appalling. Over four episodes, the Amazon Original series, out this Friday, is a perpetual unfurling of abuse.
