  <h2><a href="/post/2024/03/07/i-miss-lockdown.html">I miss lockdown</a></h2>
  
  <p>I remember during the Covid-19 lockdown that I was surprisingly happy. I thought it was solely due to my misanthropic streak or that I was far more shy than I realized. However, after experiencing a couple of years of post-lockdown life (more so because Oklahoma was one of the defiantly anti-science states), I think my understanding of myself has grown and I now know why I felt so much better during Covid than I do now.</p>

<p>For years I have believed that I fully understood my psyche. But for as long as I was certain I knew myself best, I was also firm and vocal in my stance that I was introverted but not shy ‚Äî and I think I‚Äôve been wrong all this time. <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/scoptophobia-2671835" target="_blank">I don‚Äôt like being seen</a>.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe fear of being perceived‚Äù explains much of my anxiety about so many elements of social interaction. I thought I was introverted, but I can throw aside all inhibitions when playing a character in front of others. When I‚Äôm online and hidden from a camera, I feel witty and energized. I don‚Äôt feel held back by my physicality like I do when I have to stand in front of someone and look at them in the eyes.</p>

<p>Articles about this have floated on the internet for years now without my knowledge, so this new revelation for me might be old for everyone else.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know what to do with this knowledge, though. I‚Äôve battled with feeling isolated online because I‚Äôve long felt that in-person relationships were superior. I don‚Äôt know if that is something that I feel or if that‚Äôs something that someone else has put in my head through years of pro-extroversion indoctrination. After considering that perhaps it might not be a moral wrong to be the way I am nor that being extroverted is a virtue, I think I at least take comfort in potentially knowing more why I feel the way I do.</p>

<p>There seems to be an ongoing debate as to what those of us who are incarcerated should be called. Referring to us as "prisoners" seems to be as unpopular as "inmates" does. Some even try ‚Äúerrants,‚Äù ‚Äúcons,‚Äù ‚Äúconvicts,‚Äù ‚Äúfelons,‚Äù ‚Äúreprobates,‚Äù ‚Äújailbirds,‚Äù and even ‚Äúinternees.‚Äù But none of those are any better. Some are downright insulting. ‚ÄúIncarceree?‚Äù That has such a terrible ring to it. Stop trying to get cute with it. Let us see what the U.S. Constitution has to say about it. The Thirteenth Amendment says, ‚ÄúNeither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for a crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.‚Äù Well now, that just seems to settle the debate, does it not? I'm not saying that all of us behind these walls are lovely flowers or nothing, but why call a rose by any other name and expect it to smell so sweet? Until this ‚ÄúException Clause‚Äù is removed from the Constitution and it reads, ‚ÄúNeither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction,‚Äù then call us what we are. Call us slaves.</p>

<p>The goods these prisoners produce wind up in the supply chains of a dizzying array of products found in most American kitchens, from Frosted Flakes cereal and Ball Park hot dogs to Gold Medal flour, Coca-Cola and Riceland rice.

And some goods are exported, including to countries that have had products blocked from entering the U.S. for using forced or prison labor.</p>

<p>Every Christmas a local city operates a Christmas festival in their city park during the holiday season, where people are encouraged to drive around or walk through a meandering collection of tall structures covered in Christmas lights while enjoying Christmas music, hot chocolate, ice skating, and train rides. It‚Äôs a lot of fun for me and I enjoy making the trip when I can. I hope that my children will fondly remember their visits.</p>

<p>The experience was deeply tarnished for me when I visited the park during the autumn months. The Christmas decorations were already being set up for the coming event, as the process of preparing the lights and erecting the displays is complicated and extensive. The staff working to build the decorations were inmates from the local prison, guarded by a man holding a shotgun. I felt sick and ashamed to know that my upcoming joy was prepared by those who would not be permitted to experience it, nor even who would be properly compensated monetarily for their labor. My Christmas memories were being prepared by slaves.</p>

<p>To serve users at the 75th percentile (P75) of devices and networks, we can now afford ~150KiB of HTML/CSS/fonts and ~300-350KiB of JavaScript (gzipped). This is a slight improvement on last year's budgets, thanks to device and network improvements. Meanwhile, sites continue to send more script than is reasonable for 80+% of the world's users, widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots. This is an ethical crisis for frontend.</p>

<p>Because HTML and CSS features are handled by the browser they can be more performant, more native, more adaptable to user preferences and in general, more accessible. That doesn't mean it will always be (especially when it comes to accessibility) but when the browser does the heavy lifting for you, your end users will generally have a better experience.</p>

  <h3>Hopelessness in video games</h3>
  <p>I used to play a lot of video games. These days I settle for some games from my Apple Arcade subscription, but I used to have many mobile consoles, several home consoles, and a gaming PC. I played many titles across a variety of platforms, filling out a list of memorable games that left a permanent impact on my life. In a recent conversation with my coworkers I started listing my favorite games and learned that the games that I have felt the most important in my life were ones that generated a feeling of hopelessness. I certainly enjoy a variety of gaming genres and story types, but the ones I can recall with fondness are the ones that made me feel the most miserable.</p>

  <p>I need to tell you of a grave error that I made several years ago that has haunted me ever since: gaining knowledge will only lead you to sorrow. You will never be happier than you are now by learning about the things that intrigue you. Don‚Äôt fall into the same trap as me and ruin your life like I‚Äôve ruined mine. By investigating you expose your mind to nuance, new possibilities, difficult realities, and discomfort you didn‚Äôt believe imaginable, and it will permanently change you for the worse.</p>

  <h3>We aren‚Äôt asking the right questions</h3>
  <p>The penultimate episode of <em>The Rise & Fall of Mars Hill</em> is a frustrating investigatory experience. The show presents to the listener the evidence of an abusive pastor in a permissive church system, building the case that this was an ongoing problem within the organization that eventually collapsed under the weight of the trauma dealt within. What I believe the episode fails to do and has continued to do throughout the series is to follow that evidence to its obvious conclusion, despite the pretense of seeking answers for how it all happened.</p>

  <h3>An identity crisis</h3>
  <p>I grew up in an Evangelical Christian culture. I was taught that the primary life purpose of a Christian was to propagate the message of Christianity through evangelism, sharing the story of Jesus to people who did not know or believe what was written in the Bible. Through this effort, souls would be saved from eternal damnation and more people would be prepared for the return of the savior of humanity. This mission was time-sensitive, because the return of Jesus was possible at any moment, and that event could potentially seal the fate of all living on Earth.</p>

  <h3>We know less than we realize, but that‚Äôs okay</h3>
  <p>Life during the COVID-19 pandemic has been lonelier than I expected. My introversion has been useful in this time of isolation, but it did not prepare me for the simultaneous crushing ideological loneliness that has come from watching others respond to the demands of the pandemic. I feel more disconnected from my peers now than I ever have before.</p>

  <h3>Vaccine hesitancy is putting us all at risk</h3>
  <p>The current state of skepticism about scientific studies is reaching a dangerous level. How did the support of vaccines degrade so much? Why did we start to believe conspiracies instead of the consensus from people more educated and intelligent than our neighbor?</p>

  <h3>The time that I learned about Ronald Reagan</h3>
  <p>I had grown up in a culture that spoke of Ronald Reagan almost with reverence, believing him to be one of the last great leaders of the country. I had never felt a reason to question this thought, so I never investigated the history of the presidency. This interview caused me to doubt the narrative I had heard throughout my life.</p>

            As we survey the rubble that once was the U.S. journalism industry, a common refrain involves lamenting that ‚Äúonline journalism just isn‚Äôt profitable.‚Äù But as the recent collapse of outlets like Sports Illustrated and The Messenger illustrate, the real culprit often isn‚Äôt that journalism isn‚Äôt profitable, it‚Äôs that U.S. media is predominantly run by utterly incompetent individuals who fail upward into positions of power.

            Mr. Scorsese‚Äôs approach might feel counterintuitive, even discomforting, because it is in tension with the prevailing scholarly wisdom about empathy ‚Äî Hobbes and Machiavelli notwithstanding. The fields of political and moral philosophy often presume that humans are inherently predisposed toward empathy. ‚Ä¶ It is in this moment of encounter with those wholly different from us in worldview that we experience empathy and reach the full capacity of our moral potential.
