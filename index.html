The <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/lawmakers-tiktok-ban-pro-palestinian-content-1235016101/" target="_blank">American government disappoints,</a> though. I know that Joe Biden wasn’t exactly ever that much of a left-leaning politician, but I could point to some of his mildly progressive actions as evidence that something better might be on the timeline for America. I wonder now if I will ever see that better outcome in my lifetime, especially with so many of the regressive actions happening in the Supreme Court and throughout <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article286920890.html" target="_blank">state</a> and <a href="https://oklahomavoice.com/2024/05/03/stitt-executive-order-ends-decades-old-oklahoma-womens-leadership-program-at-ou/" target="_blank">local</a> governments. If enough people choose to not vote for Biden because of his stances on Israel and Palestine and therefore allow Trump to be elected, I worry if <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/03/25/takeover-hitlers-final-rise-to-power-timothy-w-ryback-book-review" target="_blank">we will be able to steer away from</a> the dictatorship that appears to be looming. Come on though, there <em>has</em> to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kORYg4zTcoY" target="_blank">someone better out there</a> looking to run for President, right?

<p><em>Every</em> Presidential election is claimed to be the biggest decision of our lives, but the claim feels more accurate with each one in which I vote. We can and <a href="https://newrepublic.com/maz/article/180829/conservative-policies-rhetoric-kill-people" target="_blank">should do better.</a></p>

<p>I had never heard of this podcast before but decided to try it out when it came up on my podcast recommendations in Apple Podcasts. What a refreshing experience to hear men sharing their thoughts and emotions deeply and honestly. I don’t normally get to experience this type of conversation in my personal life, and I had forgotten much I craved them until I heard this episode. I appreciated that they could disagree and <em>explain</em> why they disagreed.</p>

<p>This article is incredibly vindicating. For the entirety of my time in web development I have heard the claim that HTML and CSS are too simple and beneath the threshold of what qualifies as true “development,” but this attitude has proved to be a detriment to efficient styling, accessibility, and structure for the foundational elements of what makes a webpage. Websites now appear like a chaotic mess of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">divs</code> with no structure or semantic sensibilities, and styling that lacks the proper separation of concerns that leads to efficient DRY methodologies. The diminishment of front-end development seems to cause excessive framework cycling and decent tooling for builds, leading to complicated setups for even the simplest of pages.</p>

<p>I have always had an admiration for the work that back-end developers do on a site. Their hard work in carefully tailoring APIs and databases for the most efficient calls has always impressed me. I didn’t realize how much I belittled my own experience and skills because of the outward pressure I experienced throughout my formative years along with my own sense of insecurity. I think this snobbery towards front-end development should change. Design is an essential step and front-end development requires a skill that others lack and we should all stop pretending.</p>

  <p>There seems to be an ongoing debate as to what those of us who are incarcerated should be called. Referring to us as “prisoners” seems to be as unpopular as “inmates” does. Some even try “errants,” “cons,” “convicts,” “felons,” “reprobates,” “jailbirds,” and even “internees.” But none of those are any better. Some are downright insulting. “Incarceree?” That has such a terrible ring to it. Stop trying to get cute with it. Let us see what the U.S. Constitution has to say about it. The Thirteenth Amendment says, “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for a crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” Well now, that just seems to settle the debate, does it not? I’m not saying that all of us behind these walls are lovely flowers or nothing, but why call a rose by any other name and expect it to smell so sweet? Until this “Exception Clause” is removed from the Constitution and it reads, “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction,” then call us what we are. Call us slaves.</p>

  <p>The goods these prisoners produce wind up in the supply chains of a dizzying array of products found in most American kitchens, from Frosted Flakes cereal and Ball Park hot dogs to Gold Medal flour, Coca-Cola and Riceland rice. They are on the shelves of virtually every supermarket in the country, including Kroger, Target, Aldi and Whole Foods. And some goods are exported, including to countries that have had products blocked from entering the U.S. for using forced or prison labor.</p>

<p>Every Christmas a local city operates a Christmas festival in their city park during the holiday season, where people are encouraged to drive around or walk through a meandering collection of tall structures covered in Christmas lights while enjoying Christmas music, hot chocolate, ice skating, and train rides. It’s a lot of fun for me and I enjoy making the trip when I can. I hope that my children will fondly remember their visits.</p>

<p>The experience was deeply tarnished for me when I visited the park during the autumn months. The Christmas decorations were already being set up for the coming event, as the process of preparing the lights and erecting the displays is complicated and extensive. The staff working to build the decorations were inmates from the local prison, guarded by a man holding a shotgun. I felt sick and ashamed to know that my upcoming joy was prepared by those who would not be permitted to experience it, nor even who would be properly compensated monetarily for their labor. My Christmas memories were being prepared by slaves.</p>

            <p>I remember during the Covid-19 lockdown that I was surprisingly happy. I thought it was solely due to my misanthropic streak or that I was far more shy than I realized. However, after experiencing a couple of years of post-lockdown life (more so because Oklahoma was one of the defiantly anti-science states), I think my understanding of myself has grown and I now know why I felt so much better during Covid than I do now.</p>

  <p>Front-end development seemed simpler in the early 2000s, didn’t it? The standard website consisted mostly of static pages made of HTML and CSS seasoned with a pinch of JavaScript and jQuery. I mean, who doesn’t miss the cross-browser compatibility days, right?</p>

  <p>Let’s say there is a divide happening in front-end development. I feel it, but it’s not just in my bones. Based on an awful lot of written developer sentiment, interviews Dave Rupert and I have done on ShopTalk, and in-person discussion, it’s, as they say… <em>a thing</em>.</p>

  <p>I was a bit out of touch with modern front-end development. I also remembered articles about web bloat, how the average web page size was approaching several megabytes!
So all this time I was living under impression that, for example, if the average web page size is 3 MB, then JavaScript bundle should be around 1 MB. Surely content should still take the majority, no?</p>

    <blockquote cite="https://theintercept.com/2024/04/27/backpage-com-sex-trafficking-qanon-conspiracy-moral-panic/">
      The far-right’s current obsession with “child sex trafficking” — the animating force behind such conspiracy theories as QAnon and Pizzagate, as well as coded political insults like “groomer” — has roots in this moral panic hyped by powerful Republicans and Democrats alike. The panic reached its crescendo with the 2018 federal indictments related to a sex ad hub called Backpage.com.

      Streaming services upended the royalties system that managed music for film and TV for almost a century. Due to intricate licensing deals, when TV shows get added to a streaming library, certain music cues don’t make it.

    </h3>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.wired.com/2014/06/wuwt-traffic-induced-demand/">
      The concept is called induced demand, which is economist-speak for when increasing the supply of something (like roads) makes people want that thing even more. Though some traffic engineers made note of this phenomenon at least as early as the 1960s, it is only in recent years that social scientists have collected enough data to show how this happens pretty much every time we build new roads.

      Online spaces once plastered with ads — not just publications but social networks, too — are now full of salespeople working on commission. Product recommendations have eaten the web and broken Google in the process. Meanwhile, the search giant is testing a plan — recommending more products itself — that might fix things, at least for Google.

      For more than two decades, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has nurtured a reputation as a hard-working, musclebound action-comedy movie star with considerable box-office drawing power. But “Red One,” a high-powered Christmas crowd-pleaser for Amazon MGM, has turned into a massive budgetary misadventure, casting Johnson’s fame and work ethic in a different light.
