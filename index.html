<p>This article is incredibly vindicating. For the entirety of my time in web development I have heard the claim that HTML and CSS are too simple and beneath the threshold of what qualifies as true “development,” but this attitude has proved to be a detriment to efficient styling, accessibility, and structure for the foundational elements of what makes a webpage. Websites now appear like a chaotic mess of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">divs</code> with no structure or semantic sensibilities, and styling that lacks the proper separation of concerns that leads to efficient DRY methodologies. The diminishment of front-end development seems to cause excessive framework cycling and decent tooling for builds, leading to complicated setups for even the simplest of pages.</p>

<p>I have always had an admiration for the work that back-end developers do on a site. Their hard work in carefully tailoring APIs and databases for the most efficient calls has always impressed me. I didn’t realize how much I belittled my own experience and skills because of the outward pressure I experienced throughout my formative years along with my own sense of insecurity. I think this snobbery towards front-end development should change. Design is an essential step and front-end development requires a skill that others lack and we should all stop pretending.</p>

  <p>There seems to be an ongoing debate as to what those of us who are incarcerated should be called. Referring to us as “prisoners” seems to be as unpopular as “inmates” does. Some even try “errants,” “cons,” “convicts,” “felons,” “reprobates,” “jailbirds,” and even “internees.” But none of those are any better. Some are downright insulting. “Incarceree?” That has such a terrible ring to it. Stop trying to get cute with it. Let us see what the U.S. Constitution has to say about it. The Thirteenth Amendment says, “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for a crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” Well now, that just seems to settle the debate, does it not? I’m not saying that all of us behind these walls are lovely flowers or nothing, but why call a rose by any other name and expect it to smell so sweet? Until this “Exception Clause” is removed from the Constitution and it reads, “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction,” then call us what we are. Call us slaves.</p>

<p>Every Christmas a local city operates a Christmas festival in their city park during the holiday season, where people are encouraged to drive around or walk through a meandering collection of tall structures covered in Christmas lights while enjoying Christmas music, hot chocolate, ice skating, and train rides. It’s a lot of fun for me and I enjoy making the trip when I can. I hope that my children will fondly remember their visits.</p>

<p>The experience was deeply tarnished for me when I visited the park during the autumn months. The Christmas decorations were already being set up for the coming event, as the process of preparing the lights and erecting the displays is complicated and extensive. The staff working to build the decorations were inmates from the local prison, guarded by a man holding a shotgun. I felt sick and ashamed to know that my upcoming joy was prepared by those who would not be permitted to experience it, nor even who would be properly compensated monetarily for their labor. My Christmas memories were being prepared by slaves.</p>

However, after experiencing a couple of years of post-lockdown life (more so because Oklahoma was one of the defiantly anti-science states), I think my understanding of myself has grown and I now know why I felt so much better during Covid than I do now.</p>

  <p>Front-end development seemed simpler in the early 2000s, didn’t it? The standard website consisted mostly of static pages made of HTML and CSS seasoned with a pinch of JavaScript and jQuery. I mean, who doesn’t miss the cross-browser compatibility days, right?</p>

  <p>I was a bit out of touch with modern front-end development. I also remembered articles about web bloat, how the average web page size was approaching several megabytes!
So all this time I was living under impression that, for example, if the average web page size is 3 MB, then JavaScript bundle should be around 1 MB. Surely content should still take the majority, no?</p>

  <p>To serve users at the 75th percentile (P75) of devices and networks, we can now afford ~150KiB of HTML/CSS/fonts and ~300-350KiB of JavaScript (gzipped). This is a slight improvement on last year’s budgets, thanks to device and network improvements. Meanwhile, sites continue to send more script than is reasonable for 80+% of the world’s users, widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots. This is an ethical crisis for frontend.</p>

  <p>Because HTML and CSS features are handled by the browser they can be more performant, more native, more adaptable to user preferences and in general, more accessible. That doesn’t mean it will always be (especially when it comes to accessibility) but when the browser does the heavy lifting for you, your end users will generally have a better experience.</p>

Eventually, I wondered if my self-perception could be incorrect. Could I be poisoning my life with such a crushing view of my value?</p>

            <p>I used to play a lot of video games. These days I settle for some games from my Apple Arcade subscription, but I used to have many mobile consoles, several home consoles, and a gaming PC. I played many titles across a variety of platforms, filling out a list of memorable games that left a permanent impact on my life. In a recent conversation with my coworkers I started listing my favorite games and learned that the games that I have felt the most important in my life were ones that generated a feeling of hopelessness. I certainly enjoy a variety of gaming genres and story types, but the ones I can recall with fondness are the ones that made me feel the most miserable.</p>

People have tried to persuade me and have shown me the obvious benefits to using such a platform, but I continue to remain unconvinced and I feel that I have good reason for my opinion. I will now present a rather adversarial and controversial view of why analog clocks are inferior to the newer digital clock method of presenting time. This will be a pedantic and antagonistic position.</p>

In the normalcy of daily routines, we all can fall numb to the potential dangers present in our world.

            <p>Parasocial relationships are strange. They feel closer than some friendships but are hollow facsimiles, barely reaching beyond the level of acquaintance. They are unequal connections. They do not mutually benefit all participants. Why then does losing a connection to a stranger feel nearly as bittersweet as a true bond with a known companion?</p>

You will never be happier than you are now by learning about the things that intrigue you. Don’t fall into the same trap as me and ruin your life like I’ve ruined mine. By investigating you expose your mind to nuance, new possibilities, difficult realities, and discomfort you didn’t believe imaginable, and it will permanently change you for the worse.</p>

I may be more at peace now, but the process to get to this point was potentially the most painful and disruptive I’ve yet to experience.</p>

            <p>The penultimate episode of <em>The Rise & Fall of Mars Hill</em> is a frustrating investigatory experience. The show presents to the listener the evidence of an abusive pastor in a permissive church system, building the case that this was an ongoing problem within the organization that eventually collapsed under the weight of the trauma dealt within. What I believe the episode fails to do and has continued to do throughout the series is to follow that evidence to its obvious conclusion, despite the pretense of seeking answers for how it all happened.</p>

            <p>I grew up in an Evangelical Christian culture. I was taught that the primary life purpose of a Christian was to propagate the message of Christianity through evangelism, sharing the story of Jesus to people who did not know or believe what was written in the Bible. Through this effort, souls would be saved from eternal damnation and more people would be prepared for the return of the savior of humanity. This mission was time-sensitive, because the return of Jesus was possible at any moment, and that event could potentially seal the fate of all living on Earth.</p>

      As we survey the rubble that once was the U.S. journalism industry, a common refrain involves lamenting that “online journalism just isn’t profitable.” But as the recent collapse of outlets like Sports Illustrated and The Messenger illustrate, the real culprit often isn’t that journalism isn’t profitable, it’s that U.S. media is predominantly run by utterly incompetent individuals who fail upward into positions of power.

    </h3>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/opinion/killers-flower-moon-scorsese-empathy.html">
      Mr. Scorsese’s approach might feel counterintuitive, even discomforting, because it is in tension with the prevailing scholarly wisdom about empathy — Hobbes and Machiavelli notwithstanding. The fields of political and moral philosophy often presume that humans are inherently predisposed toward empathy. … It is in this moment of encounter with those wholly different from us in worldview that we experience empathy and reach the full capacity of our moral potential. It is empathy that moves us from animal, or wolf, to human.

    <blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/20/us/dei-woke-claremont-institute.html">
      Thousands of documents obtained by The New York Times cast light on the playbook and the thinking underpinning one nexus of the anti-D.E.I. movement — the activists and intellectuals who helped shape Texas’ new law, along with measures in at least three other states. The material, which includes casual correspondence with like-minded allies around the country, also reveals unvarnished views on race, sexuality and gender roles. And despite the movement’s marked success in some Republican-dominated states, the documents chart the activists’ struggle to gain traction with broader swaths of voters and officials.

And while the trade once seemed fair, it's become apparent that these executives see users not as willing participants in some sort of fair exchange, but as veins of data to be exploitatively mined as many times as possible, given nothing in return other than access to a platform that may or may not work properly.

      It’s an increasingly common critique of the New York Times: The largest, most influential news organization in the nation is not warning sufficiently of the threat to democracy — while at the same time bashing President Joe Biden at every opportunity. And it’s been a bit of a mystery. Why would a newsroom full of talented and mostly liberal reporters be engaging in such damaging behavior? Well, mystery solved. It’s because that’s what the publisher wants.

      It is beyond obvious at this point that abortion is the Achilles’ heel of the Republican Party. The prospect of a national abortion ban almost certainly helped Democrats stave off a red wave in the 2022 midterm elections, and assisted them the following year in both statewide and state legislative races in Virginia and Kentucky. The prospect of abortion bans has also pushed voters in states such as Ohio and Michigan to approve sweeping affirmations of reproductive freedom in their respective state constitutions. And abortion looms over the 2024 race, as well; Democrats will spend countless millions to tell Americans that a vote for Trump, or any Republican on the ballot, is a vote for a national abortion ban.

Just this week, they announced an expansion of access to their digital archive, in that they’ve made nearly 88,000 images free to download on their Open Content database under Creative Commons Zero (CC0).
