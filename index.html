<p>Why does it feel like people are underwhelmed by the assassination attempt on a former U.S. President? I feel that this should be a much bigger issue than what it appears to be for most people, because for someone to be able to get that close to an important political figure is a dangerous weakness for the executive branch of the United States‚Äô government. Have we always been this <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTN5awHuL/" target="_blank">numb to violence,</a> or is this something new?</p>

<p>I wasn‚Äôt entirely certain if I wanted to comment on the latest news about a former employer. It‚Äôs been years since I worked for VOM, and I have had enough conflicted feelings about my time there that I‚Äôve largely tried to avoid speaking about them any longer. What prompted me to make this post was seeing the response that has come from the existing employee base, who have not decided to unanimously defend and believe the victims of the executive team‚Äôs cruel and vindictive behavior. This bothers me greatly, because I was one of those victims.</p>

<p>I worked for VOM for over eight years. I started as a volunteer and eventually became a full-time salaried employee, supporting the content creation and distribution across VOM‚Äôs internet presence. My work is still visible on the VOM website or social media accounts, and the memory of my contributions have continued in some of the practices that the company still employs on their web presence, not solely because of my involvement but I believe because I helped make those processes a success.</p>

<p>Simultaneously I feel as if my time there left very little impact, primarily due to how regularly the executive team constrained and attacked those within the company for attempting to make change within their roles. Retributive behavior was common, with punishments for original thought being a loss of opportunity or diminishment of roles. The executive suite was quick to punish but slow to communicate, leaving people uncertain if anything was actually planned before discovering they had overstepped bounds and were to be reprimanded for the error.</p>

<p>Part of what disturbs me about the response is that this corruption is not new nor was it unknown within the company while I was employed. I even experienced my first taste of disdain for the actions of the company within my first year. When I was new to the company I was able to overcome the cognitive dissonance through the strength of my idealism and hope in the goals of the company, but these weakened until I finally broke. By the latter half of my time with the company I had allowed the propaganda and abuse to disrupt my sense of agency, fooling me into believing that I was blessed to have a job anywhere, especially a place as self-important as VOM. It was only when I escaped, thanks to the encouragement of my wife, Lisa, that I was able to look back and see how much of a victim of abuse I was.</p>

<p>I grieve for the people still trapped in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, and in a destructive system like VOM. I worry for those who are supported by such a vindictive company who will pull support for the pettiest of grievances. They are perpetuating a system of abuse that stretches across the globe and they must be stopped.</p>

<p>The employees who are denying the reality of the pain VOM is continuing to cause may very well be active victims themselves, and with that under consideration, I can understand their response. But as someone who denied to himself for so many years the problems at VOM, along with the years of regret and healing that occurred afterward, I encourage everyone involved to reconsider the evidence and perhaps consider trusting colleagues and former employees. The unacceptable behavior being attested to has and continues to occur. The corruption is real. If you‚Äôve managed to avoid being hurt by VOM, then count your blessings, but don‚Äôt deny it to be true for others. And get out as soon as you can.</p>

The <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/lawmakers-tiktok-ban-pro-palestinian-content-1235016101/" target="_blank">American government disappoints,</a> though. I know that Joe Biden wasn‚Äôt exactly ever that much of a left-leaning politician, but I could point to some of his mildly progressive actions as evidence that something better might be on the timeline for America. I wonder now if I will ever see that better outcome in my lifetime, especially with so many of the regressive actions happening in the Supreme Court and throughout <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article286920890.html" target="_blank">state</a> and <a href="https://oklahomavoice.com/2024/05/03/stitt-executive-order-ends-decades-old-oklahoma-womens-leadership-program-at-ou/" target="_blank">local</a> governments.

<p><em>Every</em> Presidential election is claimed to be the biggest decision of our lives, but the claim feels more accurate with each one in which I vote.

<p>I had never heard of this podcast before but decided to try it out when it came up on my podcast recommendations in Apple Podcasts. What a refreshing experience to hear men sharing their thoughts and emotions deeply and honestly. I don‚Äôt normally get to experience this type of conversation in my personal life, and I had forgotten much I craved them until I heard this episode. I appreciated that they could disagree and <em>explain</em> why they disagreed.</p>

<p>This article is incredibly vindicating. For the entirety of my time in web development I have heard the claim that HTML and CSS are too simple and beneath the threshold of what qualifies as true ‚Äúdevelopment,‚Äù but this attitude has proved to be a detriment to efficient styling, accessibility, and structure for the foundational elements of what makes a webpage. Websites now appear like a chaotic mess of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">divs</code> with no structure or semantic sensibilities, and styling that lacks the proper separation of concerns that leads to efficient DRY methodologies. The diminishment of front-end development seems to cause excessive framework cycling and decent tooling for builds, leading to complicated setups for even the simplest of pages.</p>

<p>I have always had an admiration for the work that back-end developers do on a site. Their hard work in carefully tailoring APIs and databases for the most efficient calls has always impressed me. I didn‚Äôt realize how much I belittled my own experience and skills because of the outward pressure I experienced throughout my formative years along with my own sense of insecurity. I think this snobbery towards front-end development should change. Design is an essential step and front-end development requires a skill that others lack and we should all stop pretending.</p>

Some even try ‚Äúerrants,‚Äù ‚Äúcons,‚Äù ‚Äúconvicts,‚Äù ‚Äúfelons,‚Äù ‚Äúreprobates,‚Äù ‚Äújailbirds,‚Äù and even ‚Äúinternees.‚Äù But none of those are any better. Some are downright insulting. ‚ÄúIncarceree?‚Äù That has such a terrible ring to it. Stop trying to get cute with it. Let us see what the U.S. Constitution has to say about it. The Thirteenth Amendment says, ‚ÄúNeither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for a crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.‚Äù Well now, that just seems to settle the debate, does it not? I‚Äôm not saying that all of us behind these walls are lovely flowers or nothing, but why call a rose by any other name and expect it to smell so sweet? Until this ‚ÄúException Clause‚Äù is removed from the Constitution and it reads, ‚ÄúNeither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction,‚Äù then call us what we are. Call us slaves.</p>

  <p>The goods these prisoners produce wind up in the supply chains of a dizzying array of products found in most American kitchens, from Frosted Flakes cereal and Ball Park hot dogs to Gold Medal flour, Coca-Cola and Riceland rice. They are on the shelves of virtually every supermarket in the country, including Kroger, Target, Aldi and Whole Foods. And some goods are exported, including to countries that have had products blocked from entering the U.S. for using forced or prison labor.</p>

  <p>Every Christmas a local city operates a Christmas festival in their city park during the holiday season, where people are encouraged to drive around or walk through a meandering collection of tall structures covered in Christmas lights while enjoying Christmas music, hot chocolate, ice skating, and train rides. It‚Äôs a lot of fun for me and I enjoy making the trip when I can. I hope that my children will fondly remember their visits.</p>

  <p>The experience was deeply tarnished for me when I visited the park during the autumn months. The Christmas decorations were already being set up for the coming event, as the process of preparing the lights and erecting the displays is complicated and extensive. The staff working to build the decorations were inmates from the local prison, guarded by a man holding a shotgun. I felt sick and ashamed to know that my upcoming joy was prepared by those who would not be permitted to experience it, nor even who would be properly compensated monetarily for their labor. My Christmas memories were being prepared by slaves.</p>

            <p>I remember during the Covid-19 lockdown that I was surprisingly happy. I thought it was solely due to my misanthropic streak or that I was far more shy than I realized. However, after experiencing a couple of years of post-lockdown life (more so because Oklahoma was one of the defiantly anti-science states), I think my understanding of myself has grown and I now know why I felt so much better during Covid than I do now.</p>

  <p>So all this time I was living under impression that, for example, if the average web page size is 3 MB, then JavaScript bundle should be around 1 MB. Surely content should still take the majority, no?</p>

      Abortion is a highly personal decision that many women are sure they‚Äôll never have to think about until they‚Äôre suddenly faced with an unexpected pregnancy. But this can happen to anyone, including women who are strongly anti-choice. So what does an anti-choice woman do when she experiences an unwanted pregnancy herself? Often, she will grin and bear it, so to speak, but frequently, she opts for the solution she would deny to other women ‚Äî abortion.

      This week, Jamie takes a treacherous voyage into a complicated question ‚Äî why on Earth are there so many successful Mormon influencers? In this two-part series, she looks at how the origins and the values of the Mormon church deceptively align with the conservative ‚Äútradwife‚Äù influencing space of today‚Ä¶ and yes, she will get into the tradwives. Contained herein: Joseph Smith shoving his face into a hat, a new Hulu reality series that is deceptively boring, Ballerina Farm, and the Mormons‚Äô early success in the conservative mommy blogging space.

      People have this idea that life is like some kind of magical force; that the reason Mars does not have life is that life has not yet gone there; that once life goes to a place, then it just figures out how to go on living there. This, I think, is a consequence of more people having gotten their science education from the movie character Ian Malcolm than from actual science classes. More generously, it is a testament to humans having formulated nearly all of their ideas about the nature of life from the absolute easiest (and only known) place to have life.
